All with Zero Scripting.\nThis allows users to transform what is typically a resource intensive and highly error prone process into one that is automated, predictable and low risk.\nIn this guide we will learn about using MyST to deliver Automation, Auditability and Governance of Platform Change and Application Release for Oracle Middleware.\nWhen following the User Guide you will need to have access to MyST Studio. For details on installing MyST please visit the MyST Studio Installation Guide.\n"},"introduction/platform-provisioning/":{"url":"introduction/platform-provisioning/","title":"Platform Provisioning and Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Platform Provisioning and Configuration\nRubicon Red MyST delivers automated platform provisioning and configuration management for Oracle Middleware, on premise and on cloud, enabling users to deliver a consistent and reliable platform in minutes, NOT weeks or months.\nRubicon Red MyST uses a declarative approach to automation, meaning users simply define the target state of the Oracle Middleware infrastructure to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically provisioned by MyST.\nWithin MyST, the target state is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers:\n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint: this is an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware. This provides an abstraction layer over the underlying infrastructure allowing you to define a single Blueprint for all environments.\n\nSecond, the Platform Model: this overlays the environment specific configurations.\n\n\nFor each environment, we create a separate platform model to define all the environment specific configuration information.\nSplitting the “platform definition” into two layers provides infrastructure independence, enabling you to provision consistent middleware platforms across all environments regardless of infrastructure type, on premise and on cloud.\nCreating a platform blueprint, platform model, and provisioning a new fully operational FMW environment is a simple three step process which can be performed in minutes.\n\nMost Oracle Middleware products run on Oracle WebLogic Application Server. WebLogic supports the concept of a Domain to group related clusters and servers. Some organisations use separate domains for each business unit or capability, others use it to group computational workload. How it is used is up to the organisation. For Oracle products that run on WebLogic, a Platform Blueprint represents a logical definition of a WebLogic domain. For this reason, it is typical for a separate blueprint to be created in MyST Studio for each unique WebLogic domain type in an enterprise (e.g. SOA, ADF)\n\nMiddleware Infrastructure as Code\nThis declarative approach to defining target state enables MyST to treat Oracle Middleware infrastructure as code. Platform Blueprints and Platform Models are put under version control, allowing you to easily propose, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes across all your environments.\nThis means incremental configuration changes are simple to make and propagate across all environments. Users just update the required target state; MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes. With MyST there is no need to maintain complicated scripts or workflows for each configuration change, thereby eliminating human errors and simplifying on-going maintenance.\nThis capability, combined with MyST’s comprehensive governance and role based access control, enforces consistent configuration of your Oracle middleware platforms across all environments, on premise and on cloud. As a result, configuration drift, a major cause of unplanned outages, becomes a thing of the past, ensuring that code gets developed and tested in environments closely aligned to Production, for more successful deployments.\nDiscover and Manage Existing Environments\nMyST allows you to discover and manage existing environments. Simply point MyST at the existing middleware platform; MyST will introspect the platform instance and create a corresponding Platform Blueprint and Model.\nYou then use MyST to manage on-going configuration changes for the introspected platform and provision new environments with the same configuration. For example, you may want to re-provision your Dev and Test environments to ensure that their configurations are consistent with Production.\nEnables Hybrid Cloud\nWith built in support for Oracle Cloud and Amazon Web Services, MyST enables you to define a standard process for delivering Oracle Middleware on premise and on cloud.\nMyST provides cloud independence, allowing you to move your middleware infrastructure across different cloud providers as well as providing a path for migrating on-premise platforms to the cloud.\nIntegrated Process for Managing Configuration Change\nMyST Release Pipelines allow you to establish a single integrated process for automating the promotion of Oracle Middleware platform configurations through each stage of the software delivery lifecycle.\nThe powerful configuration management features in Release Pipelines provide the option to combine platform configuration changes and application deployments into a single release.\nThe Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of platform configuration changes through staging environments into Production.\nOperational Agility\nDesigned specifically for Oracle Middleware, Rubicon Red MyST enables you to quickly establish a standardized, repeatable and automated process across your organization for provisioning Oracle Middleware infrastructure and managing on-going configuration change. \nMyST provides organizations with the visibility, control and operational agility to consistently and repeatedly deliver Oracle Middleware solutions faster and with less risk\n"},"introduction/application-release-automation/":{"url":"introduction/application-release-automation/","title":"Application Release Automation","keywords":"","body":"Application Release Automation\nRubicon Red MyST is the most advanced and intuitive Application Release Automation solution for Oracle Middleware. It enables you to quickly establish a standardized, repeatable and automated process across your organization for the build and deployment of Oracle Middleware applications at each stage in the Software Delivery Pipeline. All with Zero Scripting.\nMyST shifts the experience from a slow, resource intensive and highly error prone process to a fast, reliable and low risk process that can be performed in a fraction of the time. \nDeclarative Application Deployment\nMyST uses a declarative approach to automation, meaning users simply define the target state of the application to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically deployed by MyST.\nWithin MyST, Application Blueprints are used to (1) define the artifacts to be deployed, (2) define the configuration requirements for each artifact and (3) define the configuration changes to be applied to the Oracle Middleware platform. \nApplication Models allow you to specify properties that are environment dependent, which enables seamless automated deployments across test and production environments. Application Blueprints and Models are version controlled, providing complete control over all configuration changes.\nThe declarative approach means incremental changes are simple to make and propagate across all environments. Users just update the required target state; MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.  With MyST there is no need to maintain complicated scripts or workflows for each deployment instance, eliminating errors and simplifying on-going maintenance.\nRepeatable, Reliable Process for Deploying Releases\nMyST Release Pipelines allow you to establish a standardized process for automating the deployment of Oracle Middleware applications through each stage of the software delivery lifecycle.\nThe powerful configuration management features in Release Pipelines enable you to combine multiple applications into a single release, as well as deploy a release across multiple WebLogic domains.\nThe Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of application changes and platform configuration changes through staging environments and into Production.\nGovernance and Control\nFine-grained, customizable permissions and approvals provide gating that lets you control who can approve and promote releases into each environment. In addition, automatic audit trails ensure you can meet compliance and governance requirements.\nIntegrates with Existing Build Processes\nMyST has plugins for popular continuous integration tools including Jenkins, Git, TeamCity and Bamboo; this allows you to seamlessly integrate MyST into existing build processes.\nThe output of each build is stored in a software repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus. MyST automatically tracks artifact versions as they change, including the revision of the source code used for each build. \nEnd-to-End Traceability\nMyST provides an inventory that shows which applications, artifacts, and configurations have been deployed to which environments along with dates, times and versions.\nThis provides end-to-end visibility and traceability from the version of the artifact deployed in each environment back to the revision of the source code used to build that artifact, as well as allowing detailed comparisons between what is deployed in each environment in the Release Pipeline.\n"},"infrastructure/":{"url":"infrastructure/","title":"Infrastructure Management","keywords":"","body":"Infrastructure Management\nWithin MyST, Hosts are the logical representation of the Virtual, Physical, Container or Cloud based servers that host the Oracle Middleware Server instances that make up our Oracle Middleware Platform.\nMyST allows the use of pre-existing hosts on-premise and in the cloud (for example Oracle Cloud, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure). In addition, MyST also supports the creation of cloud based hosts on-demand for some cloud environments.\nEach host in MyST has a corresponding Compute Definition, is associated with an Infrastructure Provider, and is tagged to one or more Environment Types.\nInfrastructure Provider\nAn Infrastructure Provider typically maps to a data center or a cloud provider region. MyST supports two types of infrastructure providers:\n\nPre-Existing\n: A Pre-Existing infrastructure provider is one where the hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned have been set-up and configured externally to MyST. This can be used with any existing bare-metal, virtual machines (such as VMWare, Oracle VM) or cloud providers (such as Oracle Cloud, AWS or Azure) that we want to use as the target hosts for our Oracle Middleware platforms. \nOn Demand (AWS)\n: An On-Demand (AWS) infrastructure provider is one where hosts will be created on-demand as part of the process of provisioning the Oracle Middleware platform. This approach relies upon an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is a Virtual Machine template, for creation of the target hosts that underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\nBefore registering a host or machine image with MyST it should be setup to conform to the Host Prerequisites.\nEnvironment Types\nEnvironment Types\n are typically aligned to the software delivery lifecycle (for example DEV, SIT, UAT and PROD) and are designed to help categorize Oracle Middleware Platform Instances for governance purposes. This categorization can help to manage who has access to instances, and what actions they can perform against the instance. \nCompute Definitions\nCompute Definitions\n are used to indicate operating system requirements for hosts. When we create a Platform Blueprint, we need to specify its Compute Definition. This is used to define the operating system requirements for target host as well as how MyST should interact with the host.

This categorization can help to manage who has access to instances, and what type of actions they can perform against the instance. For example:\n\nWho can provision and re-provision a platform instance?\nWho is allowed to perform platform configuration changes?\nWho is able to stop/start a platform instance?\nWho is able to deploy/promote code into an environment?\n\nWithin MyST, any resource that is environment specific, such as a Platform Model, Platform Instance, Stream Stage or Application Model, is tagged to an Environment Type. This, in conjunction with Role Based Access Control (RBAC), allows us to control who can perform which actions in which environment.\nIn addition, target hosts (see Pre-Existing Infrastructure Providers) can be tagged to one or more Environment Types. When we create a Platform Model, only the hosts tagged to the same Environment Type as the Platform Model can be selected within the model. This makes it simple to restrict the infrastructure that a given Platform can be targeted to.\nList Environment Types\nTo see a list of defined Environment Types, click  Infrastructure > Environment Types.

This is used to define the operating system requirements for target servers (i.e Virtual or Bare Metal) that will be used by any Platform Model based on the Platform Blueprint.\nWhen provisioning Platform Instances from a Blueprint on pre-existing target hosts, the Compute Definition tells MyST how it should interact with target hosts. For example, if the Compute Definition is for Solaris then MyST will know to treat the platform as if it is Solaris, instead of say Oracle Linux.\nThe Compute Definition specifies the following details about the host operating system:\n\nOS Type - The operating system type, for example Linux, Solaris.\nOS Distribution - The operating system distribution, for example Oracle Linux, RedHat Linux.\nOS Architecture - The chip architecture for the operating system, for example x86-64.\nOS Version - The version of the operating system, for example Oracle Linux 7.\n\nUse of Compute Definitions for Pre-Existing Infrastructure\nWhen adding a target host to a Pre-Existing Infrastructure Provider, we need to specify its compute definition.\nWhen we create a Platform Model to provision a middleware platform to Pre-Existing Infrastructure, one of the steps is to map the target hosts to the model. Only those target hosts which have the same Compute Definition as the Platform Blueprint are available to be assigned to the Platform Model. This feature prevents provisioning and deployment to incompatible target environments. For example, we should not be able to deploy a Platform Blueprint optimised for Solaris to a Linux target host, or vice versa, as it may lead to unintended runtime consequences.\nUse of Compute Definitions for AWS On-Demand Infrastructure\nWhen creating a Platform Model for AWS On-Demand, then the Compute Definition is used to map to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The AMI is a virtual machine template/image that is used to create the Amazon EC2 instances on demand during provisioning.\n\nList Compute Definitions\nTo see a list of defined Compute Definitions, click Infrastructure > Compute Definitions.

With this approach, MyST is dependent on a system administrator or a Configuration Management solution like Puppet or Chef to pre-configure the host before it is used as a target by MyST \nOn-demand Cloud Providers: MyST can spin up its own infrastructure using a Cloud provider. This approach relies upon a machine image which is used as a template for the Virtual Machines that are created to underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms\n\nPre-Configuring Hosts\nIn Unix/Linux, root is the account that by default has access to all commands and files on the operating system. It is a heavily guarded privilege which of course should not be given out lightly. MyST keeps it simple and does not need any root privileges to roll out Oracle Middleware platforms. By default, MyST will assume that root-privileged actions have already been performed on the host by a system administrator at the time that it uses the hosts for provisioning.\nWhen using a Cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services, an administrator or automation tool can pre-configure a Linux host with the root-privileged actions and create a template. That way, when MyST provisions Oracle Middleware platforms from scratch on a Cloud, it can use the template as the basis for the Linux hosts. This means that the root privileged actions only need to be performed once which improves security, reduces effort and results in consistent base Linux hosts for all Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\nPre-Configuring Middleware Host\nA target Linux host for Oracle Middleware typically requires root privileges to set up a number of prerequisite operating system dependencies. As such, these dependencies are often best addressed by a privileged user or tool prior to using MyST Studio to provision Oracle Middleware on to them. These dependencies are as follows:\n\nVerify that your operating system is certified and properly configured for installation and configuration.\nInstall a certified Java JDK\nVerify that the installation user has the proper permissions to install and configure the software.\nVerify that you can create the necessary directories for installation and configuration, according to the recommended directory structure.\nMake the Oracle installation binaries available\n\nOperating System Requirements\nThe following section provides a high-level overview of the minimum system requirements that need to be put in place prior to installing Oracle Fusion Middleware. You should consult the corresponding Oracle Fusion Middleware system requirements documentation to ensure that your environment meets the requirements. \n\nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.2.1\nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.1.3\nOracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.x\n\nNote: These documents cover the minimum requirements for the Oracle products you are installing and details hardware and software requirements, database schema requirements, minimum disk space and memory requirements, and required system libraries, packages, or patches.\nEnabling Unicode Support\nOracle recommends that you enable Unicode support by setting the LANG and LC_ALL environment variables to a locale with the UTF-8 character set. This enables the operating system to process any character in Unicode.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLANG\nThis environment variable sets the installation default locale. For example: setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8\n\n\nLC_ALL\nThis environment variable overrides the value of the LANG environment variable and the values of any other LC_* environment variables. For example: setenv LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8\n\n\n\nSetting Open File and Processes Limit\nAdd the following lines to the file /etc/security/limits.conf\n* soft  nofile  4096\n* hard  nofile  65536\n* soft  nproc   2047\n* hard  nproc   16384\nThe nofiles values represent the open file limit; the nproc values represent the number of processes limit.\nIf you are running Oracle Linux 6 or Red Hat Linux 6. Make sure the same values are defined in the file /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf as these can override the values in the limits.conf file.\nVerify the required packages on the target hosts\nThe following table lists the packages that must be available on the target hosts where you want to install MyST Studio. It is recommended that you consult the Oracle Fusion Middleware system requirements documentation to confirm the exact version of these packages needed by the version of Oracle Middleware being installed.\n\n\n\nPackage Name\n\n\n\n\nbinutils\n\n\ncompat-libcap1\n\n\ncompat-libstdc++-33.x86_64\n\n\ncompat-libstdc++-33.i686\n\n\ngcc\n\n\ngcc-c++\n\n\nglibc.x86_64\n\n\nglibc.i686\n\n\nglibc-devel.i686\n\n\nlibaio-devel\n\n\nlibgcc\n\n\nlibstdc++.x86_64\n\n\nlibstdc++.i686\n\n\nlibstdc++-devel\n\n\nmake\n\n\nsysstat\n\n\nunzip\n\n\n\nTable 1. Packages required on the target hosts\nThe simplest way to ensure that all of the necessary packages are installed is to use the following commands:\nsudo yum install oracle-rdbms-server-12cR1-preinstall\nsudo yum install libstdc++-devel.i686\nsudo yum install compat-libstdc++-33 compat-libstdc++-33.i686\n\nClock Synchronization\nThe clocks of all servers participating in the cluster must be synchronized to within one second difference to enable proper functioning of jobs, adapters, and Oracle B2B. \nTo accomplish this, use a single network time server and then point each server to that network time server.\nInstall Java JDK\nWe must have a version of Java Hotspot installed on each target host. This is required by the MyST agent runtime (this dependency will be removed in a future version).\nTo install Java you can run the following command:\nsudo yum install java\n\nOr use your installation method of choice. For more information see Installing Java on Linux.\nNote 1:  \n\nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.2.1 requires Java 8  \nOracle Fusion Middleware 12.1.3 and prior requires Java 7  \n\nIf you are planning on provisioning both Middleware versions on the same target hosts, ensure that both Java versions are installed and that you are referencing the correct Java home in your Platform Blueprint. This is covered in more detail in the Provisioning Section. \nNote 2:Due to a known issue with the MyST Studio SSH client, you need to create a symbolic link from /usr/bin/java to your actual java binary. For example, if your Java Home is at /usr/java/latest, run the following command on each host:\nln -s /usr/java/latest/bin/java /usr/bin/java\n\nNote 3:There is a known bug in java that can impact the performance of the Weblogic Scripting Tool (WLST).  To workaround this issue, we need to edit the file /jre/lib/security/java.security\n\nComment out the line:#securerandom.source=file:/dev/urandom\n\nAdd the following line:securerandom.source=file:/dev/./urandom\n\n\nConfiguring operating system users and groups\nWe need to create the operating system user that owns the Oracle software on each target host. \nWhen MyST installs the Oracle Middleware it will require Secure Shell (SSH) access to the target host. MyST supports user credentials provided either as password or as public key (see Configuring Infrastucture Providers for details).\nGroups\nWe need to create the following groups on each target host:\n\noinstall\ndba\n\nUsers\nYou must create the following users on each target host:\n\noracle – The user that owns the Oracle software. You may use a different name1. The primary group for this account must be oinstall. The account must also be in the dba group.\n\nnobody – An unprivileged user.\n\n\nNote:\n\nEach group must have the same Group ID on every node.\nEach user must have the same User ID on every node.\n\nTo create oracle user and group, do the following:\nsh\nsudo /usr/sbin/groupadd oinstall\nsudo /usr/sbin/groupadd dba\nsudo /usr/sbin/useradd -m -g oinstall -G dba oracle\npasswd oracle\nThe operating system user and group must have read and write access to the following directories: \n\n/u01/app/oracle2\n/opt/myst\n/tmp/mystWorkspace\n\nImportant - If any of these directories do not exist, please create them and make sure that the operating system user can read and write to them.\n1 If you use a different name for the Oracle user or group, you must update the MyST global variables oui.install.user and oui.install.group in the Platform Blueprint.\n2 /u01/app/oracle is the default base directory under which Oracle products are installed. If a different location is used, you must update the MyST global variable oracle.base in the Platform Blueprint.\nSudo Users\nThe following prerequisites are required in order to use the 'run as user' (sudo) in MyST.\n\nThe SSH user is configured in /etc/sudoers to allow sudo\n\nThe SSH user can execute /bin/bash as sudo user\n\nDisable requiretty for the ssh user in /etc/sudoers (in this case myst SSH user):Defaults:myst !requiretty\n\nMyST executes following command:sudo -i -u  bash -c \"\"  \nNote - SUDO_USER being the SSH sudo user and COMMAND being the MyST command. This information is for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n\nOracle Installation Binaries\nThe Oracle Fusion Middleware installation files should be made available on each target host as a network share.  The default location for this is /u01/app/software\nIf a different location is used, you must update the MyST global variable install.dir  in the Platform Blueprint.\nThe operating system user and group for Oracle Fusion Middleware should have read and write access to this share.\n"},"platform/":{"url":"platform/","title":"Platform Fundamentals","keywords":"","body":"Platform Fundamentals\nRubicon Red MyST uses a declarative approach to platform provisioning, meaning users simply define the target state of the Oracle Middleware infrastructure to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically provisioned by MyST.\nWithin MyST, the target state is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers:\n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint: this is an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware.

This can then be used to provision an equivalent 12c Oracle Middleware platform.\nBuilt-in Version Control\nPlatform Blueprints and Platform Models are put under version control, allowing you to easily edit, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes across all your environments.\nThis means incremental configuration changes are simple to make and propagate across all environments. Users just update the Platform Blueprint / Model to reflect the required target state; MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes. \nMyST Release Pipelines allow you to establish a single integrated process for automating the promotion of Oracle Middleware platform configurations through each stage of the software delivery lifecycle.\nEnables Hybrid Cloud\nWith built-in support for Oracle Cloud and Amazon Web Services, MyST enables you to define a standard process for delivering Oracle Middleware on premise and on cloud.\nMyST provides cloud independence, allowing you to move your middleware infrastructure across different cloud providers as well as providing a path for migrating on-premise platforms to the cloud.\nCreating a platform blueprint, platform model, and provisioning a new fully operational FMW environment is a simple three step process which can be performed in minutes.\nIn the Platform Fundamentals section we will look at:\n\nPlatform Modeling\n\nCreating Platform Blueprints   \n\nUnderstanding Platform Templates\n\nCreating Platform Models\n\nEditing Platform Blueprints and Models\n\nVersion Control\nWeb-based Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Provisioning\n\nProvisioning Platform Instances\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Change Management\n\nUpdating Platform Configuration\n\nManaging a Platform Instance\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Discovery\n\nIntrospecting an existing WebLogic Domain\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Upgrade\n\nSide-by-Side Automated Upgrade\n\n\n\n"},"platform/blueprints/":{"url":"platform/blueprints/","title":"Platform Blueprints","keywords":"","body":"Platform Blueprints\nRubicon Red MyST uses a declarative approach to automation, meaning users simply define the target state of the Oracle Middleware infrastructure to be deployed which, at the push of a button, is automatically provisioned by MyST.\nWithin MyST, the target state is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers:\n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint: this an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware.

WebLogic supports the concept of a Domain to group related clusters and servers. Some organizations use separate domains for each business unit or capability, others use it to group computational workload. How it is used is up to the organization. \nFor Oracle products that run on WebLogic, a Platform Blueprint represents a logical definition of a WebLogic domain. For this reason, it is typical for a separate blueprint to be created in MyST Studio for each unique WebLogic domain type in an enterprise (e.g. SOA, ADF)\n\nThere are three ways in which you can create a Platform Blueprint:\n\nWizard: This guides the user through a simple process to capture the key design decisions for the Oracle Middleware topology and configuration and creates a corresponding Platform Blueprint.\nTemplate: Choose from a set of pre-defined Rubicon Red certified templates to build your blueprint or use a template that you have previously created.\nIntrospection: Use MyST to discover and introspect an existing WebLogic Domain and create a corresponding Platform Blueprint.\n\nCreating a Platform Blueprint using the Wizard\nMyST Studio provides a wizard which guides the user through the end-to-end process of designing your Platform Blueprint. The wizard is used to capture key design decisions, such as:\n\nWhich Oracle Middleware product, version and components do want in your platform? \nWhat topology do you want? For example, do you want\nA separate web-tier layer?\nSeparate layers per product component?\nAn isolated admin server?\n\n\nWhat constraints do you want to add to your platform? For example, what is:\nThe minimum and maximum cluster size?\nThe target operating system?\n\n\nWhat additional platform capabilities do you want to configure? For example:\nDo you want encrypted listen addresses for your WebLogic Servers?\nDo you want to persist TLogs and JMS Stores to the database or file system?\nDo you require GridLink data sources for Oracle Middleware product schemas?\n\n\n\nBased on the answers provided, MyST will generate an Oracle EDG Compliant Platform Blueprint which can then be used to install and configure your Oracle Middleware Platform.\nLaunching the Platform Blueprint Wizard\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint. This will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n\nIn the initial dialogue, we need to specify the following details about our Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs. See Role-Based Access Control for further details.\nInitial Version - Specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint. See Platform Blueprint and Model Versioning for further details.\n\nFinally, we need to specify how we want to create the Platform Blueprint. Keep the default selection of Wizard. Then click Next.\nSpecify Oracle Middleware Components\nThe next stage is to select which Oracle Middleware components are to be included within our Platform Blueprint. First, select the Oracle Middleware Product Catalog in which we are interested, this could be one of:\n\nIntegration and Process Management\nSocial Business and Collaboration\nBusiness Intelligence\nIdentity Management\n\nNext specify the Oracle Middleware version (for example 11.1.1.7, 12.1.3, 12.2.1.0, 12.2.1.1). For the specified Oracle Middleware Product Catalog and Version, MyST will list the components that are available for inclusion within the Platform Blueprint.\n\nFinally select the required Oracle Middleware components to be included within your Platform Blueprint. You will notice that MyST automatically selects any mandatory components, for example, if you select Oracle B2B then Oracle SOA Suite will automatically be selected. \nEach Platform Blueprint can only include components from a single Product Catalog. Components that are supported in multiple Product Catalogs (e.g. Web Services Manager) appear in all the applicable Product Catalogs.\n\nOnce all components have been specified, click Next.\nSpecify Compute Groups\nIntroduction to Compute Groups\nWithin MyST, Compute Groups are used to specify the logical topology of our WebLogic Domain.\nWhen we layout out our WebLogic Domain, it is common to target different component types, such as the Web Tier, Oracle Service Bus and Oracle SOA to different groups of virtual or physical servers.  \nIn Production, for example, we could have a WebLogic Domain consisting of four Oracle Service Bus managed servers, two SOA managed servers and a web-tier consisting of two Oracle HTTP servers.  \nIt is also common for Non-Production environments, such as Continuous Integration (CI), System Integration Testing (SIT) and Pre-Production (PRE) to vary in size. For example, we may have a 4 node OSB cluster in Prod and Pre-Prod, with a two node OSB cluster in UAT and SIT and just a single node OSB and SOA (cluster) for CI.  \nAs we have already mentioned, a core objective of MyST is to enable you to use a single Platform Blueprint for all these environments, so we can ensure that each of these environments has an identical configuration and prevent issues caused by configuration drift.  \nCompute groups in MyST allow us to specify the rules for targeting component-types to specific groups of servers, as well as specify the default, minimum and maximum number of nodes in the compute group, with the actual number of nodes in the compute group being specified as part of the Platform Model, but within the constraints specified by the Platform Blueprint. This provides the flexibility required to use a single Platform Blueprint across all environments.  \nThe other consideration when specifying our domain topology, is whether to have a stand-alone admin node, in other words, whether to deploy it to its own compute group, or include it within an existing compute group.  \nAs the admin server cannot be clustered, when selecting a stand-alone admin node, MyST will set the maximum number of nodes to one. When including it within an existing compute group, MyST will only provision the admin server to the first node in the compute group.\nIf you select a stand-alone admin server in the Platform Blueprint, you still have the option of overriding this in the Platform Model. This provides an additional level of flexibility, as you may want a stand-alone admin server in Production, but to co-locate it with another managed server in some environments in order to save resources.\n \nDefine Compute Group\nTo define the Compute Groups that we want in our Platform Blueprint, we first need to specify the following values:\n\nStand-alone Admin Node - From the drop-down, select whether you want to have a stand-alone admin server (Yes) or include it within an existing Compute Group (No)\nNumber of Compute Groups - From the drop-down, select the required number of Compute Groups.\n\n\nFor each Compute Group, we need to specify the following values:\n\nName - Provide a short name (such as web, soa, osb) for the Compute Group.\nComponents - Click on the appropriate check boxes to add the required components to a Compute Group. Note: A component can only belong to a single Compute Group, so selecting it for one Compute Group will automatically deselect it from its previous Compute Group.\nNode Constraints - Specify the default, minimum and maximum number of nodes in the Compute Group. When creating a Platform Model, it will use the default value for the number of nodes. This can then be modified with the minimum and maximum constraints.\n\nFinally, we need to select from the drop-down the target compute definition for all target hosts that will be used within each Compute Group.\nOnce done, click Next.\nSpecify Other Key Configurations\nThe final stage is to specify a number of other key configuration decisions for the Platform Blueprint. \n\nMyST will default these options based on the most common configurations, we should update these details as required for our Platform Blueprint. These are:\n\nWebLogic Domain Name - Specify an appropriate WebLogic Domain Name.\nEnable Standard Listen Ports - This option is selected by default and can only be disabled if you enable SSL Listen Ports.\nEnable SSL Listen Ports - Select this option to enable SSL listen ports for the WebLogic Servers in the domain.\nEnable Administration Port - Select this option to enable the SSL administration port for  all WebLogic Servers in the domain.\nAdministration Port - Specify the port number for the SSL administration port (can only be set if the Administration Port is enabled).\nJDBC Data Source Type - This option is used to specify the Data Source Type for Oracle Middleware specific schemas which are created by the Oracle Middleware Repository Creation Utility (RCU). If using Oracle RAC, then select a GridLink Data Source, otherwise use a Generic Data Source.\nPersistence Strategy - Use this to specify whether TLOGs and JMS Stores are held on the File System or in the Database.\n\nOnce done, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing all the key inputs specified in the Platform Blueprint Wizard. \n\nOnce done, click Finish. MyST will create the corresponding Platform Blueprint and take you to the Platform Blueprint Editor where you can make additional changes if required. See Editing Platform Blueprints for further details.\nCreating a Platform Blueprint from a Pre-Defined Template\nMyST comes with a catalog of certified Platform Templates, with \"built-in\" best practices for enterprise deployment of Oracle Middleware. We can use these to create our initial Platform Blueprint.\nMyST also allows us to create our own Platform Templates, which can be used to create our initial Platform Blueprint. This can be useful if we have multiple domains in Production for the same Product Components. For example, we may have multiple SOA domains each designated to a particular line of business. Platform Templates allows us to capture a base \"Platform Blueprint\" that can be re-used to create the Platform Blueprint for each domain.\nLaunching the Platform Blueprint Wizard\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n\nIn the initial screen, we need to specify the following details about our Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs. See Role Based Access Control for further details.\nInitial Version - This specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint. See Platform Blueprint and Model Versioning for further details.\n\nFinally, we need to specify that we want to use a template to create the Platform Blueprint. Select Templateand click Next.\nSelect Template\nThe next stage is to select which template to use for our Platform Blueprint. \n\nFrom the drop-down, select the required Platform Template. MyST will display the Platform Template description, allowing you to verify that the correct template has been selected. Once selected, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing all the key inputs specified in the Platform Blueprint Wizard.\n\nOnce done, click Finish.

Both approaches result in the same work flow to create the Platform Blueprint.\nFor a full description of the Platform Blueprint concept, see the Platform Blueprints section.\n\nOption 1: Generate Platform Blueprint from Platform Templates Catalog\nFrom the side menu, navigate to Modeling > Platform Templates.  This will display the platform templates Catalog.  Click the Action > Generate Blueprint option on the desired Platform Template to start the Platform Blueprint creation process.\n\nThis will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard with the Platform Template value preset with the chosen template.  Specify a Name and a Description for the new Platform Blueprint and click Next.\n\n On the summary screen review the details of the new Platform Blueprint and click Finish to complete the process.\n \nOption 2: Create Platform Blueprint using Template Option\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Blueprint. This will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\nEnter a Name and Description for the new blueprint. Select the Template - Create from a set of pre-defined templates option from the list of blueprint create options and click Next to continue.\n\nFrom the list of available Platform Templates, select the required template on which to base the new blueprint.  Click Next to continue.\n\n\nReview the details of the new Platform Blueprint and click Finish to complete the process.\n\nCreating a Platform Template from a Platform Blueprint\nIn addition to providing pre-defined and certified Platform Templates, MyST Studio also enables custom Platform Templates to be created and published in the catalog.  This is done by saving a Platform Blueprint as a Platform Template, capturing all of the topology definition and configurations that have been made on Platform Blueprint and saving it as a Platform Template.\nSave Blueprint as Template\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Blueprint. This will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints.  Click on the desired blueprint to open it for viewing.\nFrom the Platform Blueprint editor, click the Actions button and select the Save as Template option.\n\nA blueprint must be in a committed state before it can be saved as a template.\n\nIn the New Platform Template panel specify the Name and a Description for the new Platform Template and click Save to complete the process.\n\nReview and Edit Template\nFrom the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Templates. This will display a list of existing Platform Templates.  A new template will be marked with Draft.  Clicking on the template will open it for viewing.\n\nFor a template in Draft mode, additional changes can be made to its configuration using the Edit Configuration button.  \nPublish Template\nOnce a template has been finalized, it can be published and marked as Final.  This locks the template and prevents any further changes being made to it.\n\n\n"},"platform/models/":{"url":"platform/models/","title":"Platform Models","keywords":"","body":"Platform Models\nFor each Platform Instance that we want to create, we need to create a corresponding Platform Model in MyST.\nThe Platform Model maps the Platform Blueprint to the target infrastructure for our Oracle Middleware platform and provides environment specific configuration details. MyST currently supports two types of infrastructure providers:\n\nPre-Existing: A Pre-Existing infrastructure provider is one where the hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned have been set-up and configured externally to MyST. Can be used with any existing bare-metal, virtual machines (such as VMWare, Oracle VM), or cloud providers (such as Oracle Cloud, AWS or Azure) that we want to use as the target for hosting our Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\nOn Demand (AWS): An On-Demand (AWS) infrastructure provider is one where hosts onto which the Oracle Middleware will be provisioned are created on-demand as part of the process of provisioning the Oracle Middleware platform. This approach relies upon an Amazon Machine Image which is used as a template for the Virtual Machines that are created to underpin the Oracle Middleware platforms.\n\n\nWhen we create the Platform Model, we also have the ability to override many of the configurations defined in the Platform Blueprint. This provides a mechanism to safely manage configuration differences between environments. For example, you may want detailed logging levels in a Development or Test environment, but not  in later environments.\nOnce we have created our Platform Model we are then ready to provision a Platform Instance.\nTo learn how to create a Platform Model for provisioning on-top of pre-existing infrastructure it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nCreating a Platform Model for Pre-Existing Infrastructure\n\nAlternatively, to learn how to create a Platform Model for on-demand provisioning on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nCreating a Platform Model for On-Demand AWS\n\n"},"platform/models/pre-existing/":{"url":"platform/models/pre-existing/","title":"Pre-Existing Infrastructure","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Platform Model for Pre-Existing Infrastructure\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Model, this will display a list of existing Platform Models.

This will create a new Data Source, Jdbc Data Source - 13 in the example below.\nSelect the new data source in the tree view, MyST will display its current configuration. We will see that initially none of its properties have been set.\nAn alternative way of creating a new Data Source is to select an existing data source, right click on it and select clone.\n\n\nClick on Edit to put the component into edit mode. For the purpose of our example, we will set the properties shown in the screen shot below.\n\nIt's worth noting that we have used MyST properties to define the value of the following two properties.\n\nTarget to the MyST property ${[rxr.wls.Cluster-1].name} \nUsername to ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]}_STOCK\n\nClick Save on the component.  We should now see that Target has been resolved to osb_cluster and that Username is left unresolved as ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]}_STOCK. This is because the RCU prefix will be set in our Platform Models and is not available from the Blueprint.\n\nFinally click Save & Commit.\nUpdate Platform Model\nCreate New Version of Platform Model\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. Select the Platform Model to be updated. MyST will display summary details about the Platform Model and its corresponding Platform Instance. Click on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner and select Configuration. This will open the Platform Model in the Platform Editor in view mode.\nBy default, MyST will open the Platform Model for the previous version of the Platform Blueprint. In the Control Bar select the Platform Blueprint version created in the previous step.\n\nThe Platform Editor will highlight that there is no model currently defined for that version of the Platform Blueprint. Click Create (outlined above). \nThis will open the New Platform Model Version dialogue. This will confirm the selected Platform Blueprint version that we are going to create our new Model for. Next, we need to select from the drop down an existing Platform Model we want to base our new model on. This is usually the most recent version.\nFinally provide some notes that detail the reason for the new Platform Model.\n\nOnce complete, click Save. This will create the new version of our Platform Model and return us to the Platform Editor. Here we can see that the Control Bar displays the version of our new Platform Model and that it has a status of DRAFT.\nAdd environment specific details to our Platform Model\nClick on Edit Configuration. In the tree view expand the domain and then expand the list of Data Sources within our domain. We can see that it includes the data source that we added to our Platform Blueprint.\nSelect the new data source in the tree view, MyST will display it current configuration as defined in the Platform Blueprint. We should now see that Username has been resolved to CI_STOCK, this is because the RCU prefix is set in our Platform Model.\n\nThe only values we need to specify for our Data Source in the Platform Model are:\n\nDatabase URL - This is the URL for the database that we want our Data Source to connect to. \nPassword - This is the password for corresponding Username for connecting to the database.\n\n\nNote: All stored passwords are first encrypted by MyST.\n\nClick on Edit Configuration and enter these values. \n\nOnce done, click Save to save these values within the Data Source and then click Save & Commit to save the Platform Model and commit our changes.\nPerforming a Dry Run\nWe are now ready to update our Platform Instance with its additional configuration. When we run a platform update, we have the option of specifying whether we first want to perform a dry run. \nWith a dry run, MyST doesn't perform the actual changes. Rather, it goes through the process of determining what changes need to be applied (in exactly the same way it does when making the actual changes) and then produces a report detailing the changes that will be made.\nThis allows us to quickly validate that the changes to be applied are as expected, and if not, go back and make the appropriate corrections to our Platform Blueprint and or Platform Model.\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. Select the Platform Model to be updated. MyST will display summary details about the Platform Model and its corresponding Platform Instance.\nWe can see that under Versions a list of Platform Model versions. Looking at the Instance Details we can see that the Platform Instance is currently on version1.0.0 of the Platform Blueprint\\Model.\n\nClick on the Actions drop-down and select Update, MyST will open the Platform Instance Update dialogue.\n\nFor the Update type select the option to Update to higher version and from the dropdown select the new version of our Platform Model.\nNext, ensure the check-box Do a dry run has been selected. Lastly, enter any updated notes and then click Update. MyST will initiate the Dry run and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\n\nOnce the Dry run has completed, click on View (outlined above) under Execution log. This will open a window showing the result of the Dry run, as shown below.\nThis will show details of all the changes that will be made when we execute an actual update.\n\nPerform Platform Instance Update\nThe process for performing an update against the Platform Instance to apply the changes in our Platform Blueprint / Model is the same as performing a Dry run. Only this time ensure the check-box Do a dry run has not been selected.\nOnce we have initiated the update, MyST will return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance where we should see the update in progress. Once completed, the Provisioned version under Instance Details will now show the new version of the Platform Model.\n\nIf we click View under Execution log this will open a window showing the execution log for the update, as shown below.\n\nWhilst this example configuration change showed us adding a new data source, we would follow an identical approach if modifying an existing data source. In the latter case we would be updating an existing data source configuration in the Platform Blueprint. MyST will determine and perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.\n\nSee Platform Configuration for details on how define other configuration requirements within a Platform Blueprint / Model.\n"},"platform/definitions/":{"url":"platform/definitions/","title":"Maintaining Platform Definitions","keywords":"","body":"Maintaining Platform Definitions\nWithin MyST, the target state of each Platform Instance is captured in the “platform definition”, which is divided into two layers: \n\nFirst, the Platform Blueprint defines an environment agnostic specification used to define the platform topology and configuration of your Oracle Middleware. \nSecond, the Platform Model overlays the environment specific configurations. \n\nThis “platform definition” is used to manage the entire platform lifecycle from provisioning the initial platform instance through to managing on-going configuration changes.\nThis means incremental configuration changes are simple\n to make and propagate across all environments. Users just\n update the target state in the Platform Blueprint / Model and then deploy these changes as required against the Platform Instance. MyST will determine and\n perform the required steps to apply the necessary changes.\nThis declarative approach to defining target state enables MyST to treat Oracle Middleware infrastructure as code. Platform Blueprints and Models are put under version control, allowing us to easily propose, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes.\nTo learn how to create a Platform Blueprints and Models can be Version Controlled it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nUnderstanding Platform Blueprint and Model Version Control\n\nTo learn how to edit configuration for Platform Blueprints and Models it is recommended to follow the guide:\n\nEditing Platform Blueprints and Models\n\n"},"platform/definitions/version-control/":{"url":"platform/definitions/version-control/","title":"Platform Version Control","keywords":"","body":"Platform Version Control\nWithin MyST, Platform Blueprints and Models are put under version control, allowing us to easily propose, review, test, promote and deploy configuration changes. \nPlatform Blueprint Versions\nOver the Platform Lifecycle we can have multiple versions of a Platform Blueprint, though we would typically have a maximum of two versions under development at any point in time, one for main development (like a trunk in version control) and another one optionally for patches (like a production fix branch in version control).\nWe can make multiple revisions to a version of a Platform Blueprint. Although not mandated by MyST, it is expected that we would work on a single version of a Platform Blueprint until it gets promoted to Production, at which point we would set its state to FINAL and start working on a newer version.\nWhen working on a new revision, the revision is initially in a DRAFT state. Whilst in a draft state, MyST allows us to save configuration in draft form repeatedly, overwriting the previous draft, without actually committing or applying them to any Platform Instance. \nOnce we are happy with our changes, MyST allows us to explicitly commit the revision permanently to source control (which can then be applied to a Platform Instance). If we make any subsequent changes, then MyST will automatically create a newer revision.\nMyST allows us to go back to any previously committed revision.\n\nIn MyST, a platform blueprint version obeys the naming convention, 1.0.0[pr3]. Here, 1.0.0 is the version of the blueprint, pr is the standard prefix for a platform blueprint revision and 3 is the current revision number for it.\nPlatform Model Versions\nFor each Platform Instance that we want to create, we need to create a corresponding Platform Model in MyST. For example, if we wanted to create DEV, TST, and PROD environments, we would create three Platform Models.\nFor each version of a Platform Blueprint, we can have exactly one version of each Platform Model associated with it. Remember, the Platform Model is meant to track environment specific changes to the configuration over time (passwords, endpoints, memory settings, etc). Changes to this configuration can also be independently tracked through revisions, which again can be in draft state and then subsequently in committed state for them to become eligible for applying to the target environment.\nIn MyST, a Platform Model version obeys the naming convention, 1.0.0[pr3][pm4]. Here, 1.0.0[pr3] just refers to the Platform Blueprint version and its current revision, pm is the standard prefix for a Platform Model revision and 4 is the current revision number for it.\nPlease note that the Platform Model can be revised independently of revisions to the Platform Blueprint and there is no hard relationship between them. The association exists between the Platform Model version and the Platform Blueprint version while the revisions evolve independently.\nDraft, Committed and Final States\nPlatform Blueprint and Models in MyST can be in one of three states:\n\nDraft - Means that the current revision of the Platform Blueprint / Model version being viewed is still in a draft state and is not committed, hence will not be acted upon by a release pipeline (see below). It also implies that this revision cannot be applied to any environments (unless they allow drafts which is an exception rather than the rule).\n\nCommitted - Means that the current revision of the Platform Blueprint / Model version being viewed has been committed, hence will be acted upon by a release pipeline if configured to do so. It also implies, in the case of a Platform Blueprint, that this revision can be applied to all environments. Any subsequent changes will automatically be saved in a new revision.\n\nFinal - Means that the current version of the Platform Blueprint / Model being viewed is finalized (most likely because it has been promoted all the way to production). Any subsequent changes to configuration will have to be made in a new version.\n\n\nPlatform Blueprint Development Lifecycle\nSince MyST allows us to treat configuration as code, it allows us to follow a similar process when promoting platform configurations from development through our staging environments and into Production.\nPlatform Blueprint Development\nBy default, Platform Blueprint / Model revisions in a draft state cannot be applied to any environment. This is to prevent unfinished changes from accidentally being applied. \nHowever, when developing the initial Platform Blueprint or if making a significant change then the blueprint developer may want to frequently save and test their changes in DEV or SANDBOX environment, without wanting to commit these changes each time.\nTo support this scenario, MyST allows us to configure an Environment Type as allowing draft revisions to be applied.\nPlatform instances with an Environment Type that allows provisioning/updating of draft Platform Instances cannot be used in a Release Pipeline.\nPromoting Platform Blueprints\nOnce a revision to a Platform Blueprint has been committed, we will typically want to promote this to our first staging environment, validate and test it in that environment and, once passed, promote it to the next staging environment and so on.\nIf at any stage, the Platform Blueprint fails validation, we would update the Platform Blueprint to fix the issue and commit the change to version control. We would then re-start the process of promoting the latest revision of our Platform Blueprint through each of our staging environments until the Platform Blueprint is successfully promoted into Production.\nMyST supports two methods for promoting Platform Blueprints through each environment:\n\nManual - Users manually trigger MyST to upgrade a Platform Instance to a new version/revision of a Platform Blueprint / Model (see xxx for details). With this approach, the user is responsible for managing the promotion process.\nRelease Pipeline - A Release Pipeline can be used for managing the process of promoting a new version/revision of a Platform Blueprint through each staging environment and into production.\n\nImplementing Continuous Integration / Delivery for Platform Configuration\nRelease Pipelines allow us to implement a continuous integration/delivery process for promoting platform configuration changes.\nAs a first step towards continuous delivery, one normally would set up a continuous integration server and a CI environment where code gets deployed to every time a commit happens. \nSimilarly, every configuration change can be and should be applied continuously to a CI environment on a commit. For this, MyST plays the role of a CI server for configuration where it periodically polls for committed Platform Blueprint changes and then applies these changes to the target CI environment.\nOnce applied, MyST can trigger an automated test to validate the configuration changes, in a similar way that we would when deploying code. \nOnce a particular revision of a Platform Blueprint has been successfully promoted to CI, then we can use the Release Pipeline to promote the change to the next staging environment and so on. For each stage, we can define whether MyST automatically promotes the Platform Blueprint or whether it needs to be manually approved. \nThe Release Pipeline allows us to track the promotion of committed changes through each stage, providing the visibility as to what version/revision of a Platform Blueprint is currently deployed in each staging environment.\nMyST allows us to combine the promotion of code and configuration into a release pipeline. \nFor more details on how to configure a release pipeline see Release Pipelines.\nTying it all together - An example\nWe have a platform blueprint, SOA 12.2.1.0.0, having one version, 1.0.0 and the latest revision of 1 in COMMITTED state, i.e. 1.0.0[pr1].\n\nWe have 5 environments, CI, SIT, UAT, PREPROD and PROD, all of which do not allow draft configuration to be provisioned/applied to them (default behavior)\n\nWe have 5 Platform Models for the above Platform Blueprint, one for each of the 5 environments. All of them have only 1 revision for the 1.0.0 blueprint version in COMMITTED state, i.e. [pm1] which when combined with the Platform Blueprint would read as 1.0.0[pr1][pm1].\n\nWe have an active release pipeline, DEFAULT_DEV_PIPELINE, tracking configuration changes through the 5 environments above.\n\nAs can be seen from above the CI and SIT stages are already provisioned while the UAT stage is pending approval.\nNow make any change to the Platform Blueprint and save it. This will generate revision pr2 for the Platform Blueprint in DRAFT state. Take care to not use the Save+Commit option to commit the change.\n\nIf we go back to the release pipeline dashboard, it will continue to show pr1 as the latest revision for the Platform Blueprint. This is because we have not yet committed pr2.\n\nIf we now commit revision pr2 and return to the dashboard. It will now show pr2 as the latest revision available in the build column.\n\nIf we wait for the pipeline to execute (or click Run Now to force execute it), we can see that the new revision automatically gets applied to the CI stage.\n\nThis shows how only committed revisions of Platform Blueprints / Models are considered by the release pipeline for promotion.\nIn a similar manner, we can make a change to the Platform Model for the CI or SIT stage and see that these will not be applied by the pipeline until the changes are committed.\n"},"platform/definitions/editor/":{"url":"platform/definitions/editor/","title":"Platform Editor","keywords":"","body":"Platform Editor\nMyST holds the configuration details of a Platform Blueprint and Platform Model in a hierarchical or tree-like structure. The Platform Editor is used to view and edit Platform Blueprints and Platform Models.\nOpening a Platform Blueprint in the Platform Editor\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the Platform Blueprint we want to view / edit and select Open. This will open the Platform Blueprint in the Platform Editor in view mode.\n\nOpening a Platform Model in the Platform Editor\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models.

This will open the Platform Model in the Platform Editor in view mode.\nPlatform Editor Layout\nThe Platform Editor is split into four core sections:\n\nControl Bar - Displays the version, revison and state of the Platform Blueprint or Model you are viewing, plus allows you to perform actions such as editing.\nTree View - Displays a hierarchical view of the Platform Blueprint. That can be used to navigate the Platform Blueprint or Model configuration. Selecting a component in the tree view will display a list of properties defined for that component in the properties view.\nTopology View - Helps to visualize the configuration that is defined in the Platform Blueprint or Model.

See ...\nIn addition, the Actions drop down allows you to perform a number of additional actions, these are:\n\nSave as new version - Allows you to create a new version of the Platform Blueprint\nDelete - Allows you to delete the current version of the Platform Blueprint or Model. Note we can only delete a Platform Model that does not have an active Platform Instance and we can only delete a Platform Blueprint that does not have any dependent Platform Models.\nPublish - Sets the status of the Platform Blueprint or Model to FINAL meaning no further changes can be made against that version.\n\nTree View\nMyST holds the configuration details of a Platform Blueprint and Platform Model in a hierarchical or tree-like structure, consisting of the following object types:\n\nproperty - Primitive type consisting of a key-value pair used to hold the value of a property.\ncomponent - Complex type consisting of a pre-defined collection of object types.\nlist - Complex type consisting of a list of zero, one or more components of the same type.\nparamList - List of zero, one or more property types.\n\nThe Tree View provides a hierarchical view of the Platform Blueprint and Platform Model, providing a simple way to navigate the configuration details of a Platform Blueprint or Model.\nClicking on the plus sign () of a component will expand it to show any child components. Selecting a child element will display the list of properties and values defined for that component in the properties view. \nAt the top level, a Platform Blueprint or Model will consist of some or all of the following components:\n\nGlobal Variables - List of zero, one or more string property types.\nMiddleware Settings - Defines core properties such as the Oracle Base and Oracle Middleware home directory.\nProducts - Defines the core products that make up the Platform, such as Java, WebLogic, Oracle SOA, etc.\nCompute Groups - Defines the Compute Groups for the Platform.\nLoad Balancers - Configuration details for Load Balancers\nWebTier Configuration - Configuration details for Oracle Http Server\nWebLogic Domain - Configuration details of the WebLogic domain\nKeystores - Holds details of any Keystores used by the Platform\n\nTopology View\nThe topology view provides a summary visualization of your Platform Blueprint or Model and provides a quick shortcut for referencing key components. Specifically, it displays:\n\nLoad Balancer - Clicking on this will select the LoadBalancer component located at [Blueprint|Model] > Load Balancers > LoadBalancer and display its corresponding properties in the Property View.\nCompute Groups - The topology view shows each Compute Group and the components it contains. Clicking on a Compute Group will select the corresponding Compute Group element in the Platform Blueprint or Model located at [Blueprint|Model] > Compute Groups > [Compute Group Name] and display its corresponding properties in the Property View.\nClusters - The topology view shows each WebLogic Cluster and the corresponding Product Components. Clicking on a WebLogic Cluster will select the corresponding component in the Platform located at [Blueprint|Model] > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > WebLogic Clusters > [Cluster Name] and display its corresponding properties in the Property View.\nProduct - Clicking on a Product will select the corresponding component in the Platform located at [Blueprint|Model] > Products > [component_name] and display its corresponding properties in the Property View.\n\nProperty View\nThe Property View displays the properties and values for the selected component. A component may also contain other components. For example, the screenshot below shows the properties for the soa_domain component. This contains the component Credentials which has the properties Username and Password.\nTo expand a component within the property view click on the + symbol, and to collapse a component click on the - symbol. Alternatively to expand or collapse all components within the property view click on the corresponding Expand All or Collapse All button.\n\nBy default, MyST only shows the core properties for a component. To see all properties, select Show advanced properties (outlined in red above).\nMyST auto-computes many of the property values in accordance with Oracle Enterprise Deployment Guide.  The auto-computed values are highlighted in green, if we choose to change any of these, then MyST will display the user entered property in white.\nEditing Properties\nTo edit either a Platform Blueprint or Platform Model, click Edit Configuration. This will put the Platform Editor in Edit mode. \nWhen defining the value of a property, we can reference the value of one or more other properties, see MyST Property Overview. Once in Edit mode, the Property Viewer will display the property definition for calculating the property value, which may include references to other property values. Underneath that, MyST will display the actual resolved (or calculated) value of the property after property references have been substituted with actual values, as shown below.\n\nTo edit a property, within the TreeView browse to the component where you want to make changes and click Edit(outlined in red below).\n\nThis will allow you to edit the property definitions for each property within the selected component. Once you have finished making your changes, click Save.\nImportant\n\n\nSaving changes at the component level only saves the changes with the current editing session. The Platform Editor allows you to make all the changes you need to the Platform Blueprint or Model, and save them to the MyST Repository all at once by clicking Apply Changes Alternatively, clicking Discard Changes will discard all the changes made within the current Edit Session. \n\nAny edits made to a Property Definition which have not yet been saved to the MyST Repository are highlighted in yellow to indicate this.\n\nEvery time you apply changes to a blueprint version, a new revision is automatically created of the blueprint. From the  editor, we can only view the latest revision of the blueprint. If the latest revision of the blueprint is not the same as the last revision used to provision or change an instance, we will need to update the Platform Model before the new revision changes are applied.\n\nProperty Expansion in MyST\nTo make editing and maintenance of Platform Blueprints easier, MyST supports property expansion when defining the value of a property. This allows us to define the value of a property based on the value of one or more other properties.\nWhen a string of the format ${some.property} appears in a property value it will be expanded to the value of the specified property.\nFor example, if we have the following properties:\n\noracle.base - Defines the Oracle Home directory for installing the Oracle Middleware Platform. \noui.inventory.directory - Defines the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) Inventory Directory\n\nThe default location for (OUI) Inventory Directory is to place this in the sub-directory oraInventory under the Oracle Home. MyST enables us to set the value of the property oui.inventory.directory to  ${var.oracle.base}/oraInventory.\nReferencing MyST Properties\nWhen referencing a MyST property, in order to uniquely identify it, we need to specify the full path of the property within the Platform Blueprint or Model.\nThe simplest way to derive the expression to reference a property is to locate the property we wish to reference within the Property Viewer and click on the Property Name. MyST will open a speech bubble containing the expression to reference the property as shown below.\n\nThe Platform Editor needs to be in Edit mode in order to be able to view a property reference expression.\n\nUnderstand the MyST Property Path\nIn general, a dot notation is used to traverse the property hierarchy. For example, a.b.c would mean locate c within b within a. \nThe following table lists the property path for the top-level components in the Platform Blueprint and the Platform Model.\n\n\n\nComponent\nProperty Path\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Variables\nvar\n\n\nMiddleware Settings\nrxr.wls.Fmw-1\n\n\nProducts\nrxr.def\n\n\nCompute Groups\nrxr.infra\n\n\nLoad Balancers\nrxr.infra\n\n\nWebTier Configuration\nrxr.infra\n\n\nWebLogic Domain\nrxr.wls\n\n\nKeystores\nrxr.def\n\n\n\nReferencing a property value within a component\nA component is a complex type consisting of a pre-defined collection of object types. To reference a property value within a component we used the following syntax:\n.\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the property.\n - Is the key for the property whose value we are referencing within the component.\n\nFor example, within a Platform Blueprint or Model, we have the Middleware Settings component, to reference the version property value, we would use the expression: \n${[rxr.wls.Fmw-1].version}\nIn this example:\n\nrxr.wls.Fmw-1 is the  as defined in the table.\nversion is the .\n\nReferencing a child component within a parent component\nReference a child component within a parent component we use the following syntax:\n.\nWhere:  \n\n - Is the path to the component containing the child component.\n - Is the key for the component that we are referencing within the parent component.\n\nReferencing a component within a list\nA list is a complex type consisting of a list of zero, one or more components of the same type. \nTo reference a component within a list we use the following syntax:\n[.-]\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the list.\n - Is the component type held in the list\n - Is the key for the component that we are referencing within the list. \n\nFor example, a Platform Blueprint contains a list of Products (for example Java, SOA, Service Bus, RCU) that will be installed. In this example, if we want to reference the RCU component, we would use the expression:\n[rxr.def.Product-rcu]\nWhere\n\n is rxr.def as defined in the xxxx table.\nProduct is the .\nrcu is the  for the RCU product component in the list \n\nTo reference the RCU product version we would use the expression:   \n${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].version}\nFor many lists, the component key defaults to the index number of the object stored in the list. For example, a WebLogic Domain contains a list of WebLogic Clusters. In this example: \n\nThe WebLogic Domain is the object containing the list. So  is rxr.wls\nCluster is the component type stored in the list.\n1 is the component key for the first cluster, 2 the component key for the second cluster, and so on.\n\nThus the component property path to the second cluster in the list would be expressed as [rxr.wls.Cluster-2]. To reference the cluster name we would use the expression:${[rxr.wls.Cluster-2].name}\nReferencing a property value within a property of type paramList\nAs we mentioned earlier, a component is a complex type consisting of a pre-defined collection of object types. However, we often want to add additional properties to a component, that aren't defined in advance. \nWe can do this using a paramList. A paramList is a list of zero, one or more property types. The list of properties is not fixed and can be added to using the Platform Editor.\nTo reference a property value within aparamList we use the following syntax:\n.param[]\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the paramList\n - Is the key for the property stored in the paramList\n\nFor example, the Oracle SOA Suite Product object contains a Name-Value Parameter list, that contains a number of string properties, such as audit-level and base-port. To reference the base-port value we would use the expression:  \n${[rxr.def.Product-soa].param[base-port]}\nReferencing a global variable value\nMyST supports the notion of global variables. These are essentially held as a paramList. To reference a global property value within a component we used the following syntax:  \n${.}\nWhere\n\n - Is the path to the component containing the property.  \n - Is the key for the property whose value we are referencing within the component.\n\nFor example, to reference the value of global variable install.directory, we would use the expression:\n${var.install.directory}\n\n"},"platform/management/":{"url":"platform/management/","title":"Managing Instances","keywords":"","body":"Managing Instances\nIn this section we detail how to use MyST to perform common platform administration tasks, including how to:\n\nView a Platform Instance Configuration\nReport on a Platform Instance\nStart, Stop and Restart a Platform Instance\nCheck for and Correct Configuration Drift\nTerminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance\nPatch a Platform Instance\nOverride the state of a Platform Instance\n\nIn addition, we also cover the mechanism MyST uses to queue actions against a Platform Instance as well as how to view the Action History and current Pending Actions.\nAll of these activities are performed from the Platform Instance Summary window.

When performing these actions, we can choose to perform these actions against the entire cluster or we can choose to perform the action on specific nodes within the cluster.\nStopping a Platform Instance\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Control, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialogue.\n\nSelect Stop as the action to perform (outlined in red above). By default, MyST will apply this action to all nodes within the cluster. If we only want to stop specific nodes, then first remove the nodes that we don't want to perform this action on.\nEnter any notes as to why we are performing the action and click Execute.\nMyST will queue the action in the list of Pending Actions for the Platform Instance and, when ready, will proceed to stop the Platform Instance.\n\nStarting a Platform Instance\nTo start a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select Start as the action to perform.\nRestarting a Platform Instance\nTo restart a Platform Instance we follow the same process for stopping a Platform Instance, but select Restart as the action to perform.\nCheck for and Correct Configuration Drift\nConfiguration drift is caused by inconsistent configuration across different environments. Configuration drift occurs naturally in data center environments due to manual adhoc changes.\nMyST's approach to managing incremental change allows us to define, test, promote and track configuration changes across all environments and thus prevent configuration drift from occurring.\nHowever, this does not stop someone from directly using the WebLogic console to perform manual changes. When this occurs, we want the ability to detect such a change, and then either use MyST to restore the Platform Instance to its correct state or alternatively if the change is required, to incorporate the change into the Platform Blueprint so it can be applied consistently across all environments.\nNote: Many MyST users restrict their users from making configuration changes via the WebLogic console to prevent these scenarios' from occurring.\nCheck for Drift\nMyST's Check for Drift capability allows us to check the configuration of the Platform Instance as defined by its Platform Blueprint / Model against the actual WebLogic domain and report on differences.\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Check for Drift, MyST will initiate the check for drift process.\n\nOnce completed, click on View execution log. MyST will display the results.\n\nIn the above report, we can see that the value of the property MaxCapacity has drifted to 100. \nReset Drift\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Control, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialogue.\n\nSelect Reset Drift as the action to perform (outlined in red above) add any Action Notes and click Execute. MyST will queue the Reset Drift action for execution and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\nOnce the Reset Drift action has completed, click on View under Execution log. This will open a window showing the result of the Drift, as shown below.\n\nThis will show details of all the changes made to correct any configuration drift. We can see from the log (outlined above) that MyST has reset the MaxCapacity property on the StockDS Data Source.\nWith MyST, we can run Check for Drift\nTerminate and Re-Provision a Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to terminate and re-provision our Platform Instances. This can be useful for a number of reasons:\n\nReset a Platform Instance to a previous known state, for example, re-provision the Platform Instance based on an earlier version of the Platform Blueprint.\nTemporarily re-purpose the infrastructure, knowing we can re-provision the platform instance when required at a future date.\nRe-provision corrupted environment, for example, if we suspect the underlying file system has been corrupted, we can re-provision the platform instance.\n\nTerminate a Platform Instance\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Terminate, MyST will open the Terminate Platform Instance dialogue and prompt for confirmation to proceed.\n\nClick OK. MyST will queue the Terminate action for execution and return us to the summary view of the Platform Model and Instance.\n\nOnce terminated the status of the Platform Instance will be updated to TERMINATED and the Instance Details will indicate Instance Not Provisioned.\n\nEven though the Platform Instance has been terminated, we still have access to the Action History of the terminated instance.\nTerminate AWS On-Demand\nWhen terminating a Platform Instance running on infrastructure of type AWS On-Demand, MyST will also provide you with the option of terminating the AWS Instances\n\nIf we select this option, MyST will terminate the AWS EC2 instances that were provisioned on-demand when the original Platform Instance was provisioned.\nRe-Provisioning a Terminated Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to re-provision any previously terminated Platform Instance. \nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Models, this will display a list of existing Platform Models. \nTo re-provision a terminated Platform Instance, select the corresponding Platform Model, MyST will display the Platform Model and Instance summary. Click on the Actions menu and select Provision.\nMyST will open the New Platform Instance dialogue. Here we can select which version of the Platform Instance we want to re-provision. Once selected, enter any Provisioning Notes and click Finish.\nPatching a Platform Instance\nMyST allows us to easily patch a Platform Instance. When performing these actions, we can choose to perform these actions against the entire cluster or we can choose to perform the action on specific nodes within the cluster.\nBefore applying a patch to a Platform Instance, we must first add the patches to the Platform Blueprint - see Oracle Patches for further details.\nFrom within the Platform Instance Summary window, click on the Actions drop-down and select Control, MyST will open the Platform Instance Control dialogue.\n\nSelect Patch as the action to perform (outlined in red above). By default, MyST will apply this action to all nodes within the cluster. If we only want to patch specific nodes, then first remove the nodes that we don't want to perform this action on.\nSpecify whether a server restart is required to apply the patch, then enter any notes as to why we are performing the action and click Execute.\nMyST will queue the action in the list of Pending Actions for the Platform Instance and when ready proceed to patch the Platform Instance.\n\n\n"},"platform/introspection/":{"url":"platform/introspection/","title":"Introspecting Existing Instances","keywords":"","body":"Introspecting Existing Instances\nMyST allows us to create a Platform Blueprint based on an existing WebLogic Domain, we simply point MyST at an existing WebLogic Domain, MyST will introspect the platform instance and create a corresponding Platform Blueprint. MyST also provides the option to create a corresponding Platform Model.\nThis supports a number of use cases, including:\n\nSide-By-Side Upgrade - We can introspect an existing 11g environment, extract the key configuration information and then use this to automatically provision an equivalent 12c environment in minutes.\n\nLift and Shift to the Cloud - We can introspect an existing 11g/12c environment and then use MyST to provision an equivalent environment to the cloud.\n\nManage Existing Platform Instance - When introspecting a Platform instance, we have the option of creating a Platform Model for the introspected WebLogic Domain, we can then use MyST to manage on-going configuration changes and code deployments to the introspected platform.\n\nReplicate PROD Environment - We can introspect an existing 11g/12c environment, for example Production, and then use this to provision equivalent non-prod environments (e.g. DEV, SIT, UAT, PRE), and thus quickly ensure that all environments are identically configured and eliminate configuration drift.\n\n\nThe end-to-end process consists of three simple steps and can be performed in minutes.\nStep 1. Identify WebLogic Domain to Introspect\nFor the purpose of this documentation, we are going to introspect an existing Oracle SOA 11.1.1.7 environment running on two VMs, that consists of a 2 node SOA Cluster and 2 node OSB Cluster, as illustrated in the WebLogic Admin Console.\n\nNote: MyST supports introspection of 11.1.1.7, 12.1.3 and 12.2.1 WebLogic, SOA, OSB and BPM environments.\nStep 2. Define WebLogic Domain to MyST\nBefore we can introspect an existing domain we need to provide details of the physical or virtual servers that the WebLogic domain is to be provisioned to, plus SSH connection details.\nTo do this in MyST, we need to add each WebLogic host to the Pre-Existing Infrastructure Providers. From the side menu navigate toInfrastructure > Infrastructure Providers, this will display a list of existing Infrastructure Providers. From here, open the required Infrastructure Provider (or simply add a new one).\nThis will open the Infrastructure Providers screen. From here we need to define a host for each of our existing WebLogic hosts. To do this, click Add Host.\n\nFor each host we need to specify the following details:\n\nName - Name within MyST used to refer to the host.\nHost Name - Network address of the host, can also be the IP Address.\nCompute Definition - Used to specify the Operating System of the target host.\nSSH Port - The SSH Port of the target host, defaults to 22.\nEnvironment(s) - Hosts must be tagged to one or more Environments. This integrates with the Role Based Access Control to define who has access to the host.\nOS agent credentials - The OS agent credentials is the set of credentials that MyST uses to connect to the host over SSH and run the MyST introspection agent on the host. These credentials consist of the SSH user name and either a password or a key pair (these are also defined within the Infrastructure Provide.\n\nConfigure OS Agent Credential - For introspection purposes, we can leave this set to No.\n\n\nStep 3. Introspect SOA / BPM Domain\nFrom the side menu navigate toModeling > Platform Blueprint, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n\nIn the initial dialogue we need to specify the following details about our Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint.\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint.\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs. See Role-Based Access Control for further details.\nInitial Version - Specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint, we will stick with the default.\n\nFinally, we need to specify that we want to use introspection to create the Platform Blueprint. Select Introspect and click Next.\nSpecify WebLogic Domain to Introspect\nNext, we need to specify the host for the WebLogic Admin Server. First select the infrastructure provider where we defined our WebLogic hosts (in step 1), then from the drop down select the host for the WebLogic Admin Server.\n\nNext specify the absolute location of the WebLogic Domain home directory, which is something like:\n/u01/app/oracle/admin//aserver/\nAt this point we are not going to create a Platform Model, so leave the default option of No for this drop down.\nFinally, click introspect. MyST will introspect the target Platform Instance. Click Next to view the summary.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a Summary screen showing details of the introspected Platform.\n\nOnce done, click Finish.\nView/Edit Platform Blueprint\nMyST will create the corresponding Platform Blueprint and take you to the Platform Blueprint Editor where you can make additional configuration changes if required.\n\nWe can now use this Platform Blueprint to provision an equivalent WebLogic Domain either on-premise or in the cloud.\nAlternatively, we can upgrade the Platform Blueprint to a newer version and use it provision an equivalent upgraded environment - see Upgrading an Existing Platform for further details.\n"},"platform/upgrade/":{"url":"platform/upgrade/","title":"Upgrading Instances","keywords":"","body":"Upgrading Instances\nIn order to get the latest bug fixes and feature enhancements from your Oracle product investments, regular updates need to be applied. Fundamentally, there are two types of updates:\n\nOne-off patches: These are provided by Oracle and available for download from My Oracle Support to fix a specific defect or add a minor enhancement. One-off patches can be applied directly through MyST by first defining them within a Platform Blueprint then applying them to a Platform Instance.\n\n\nUpgrades: An upgrade will introduce a significant number of bug fixes and major enhancements in one hit. Without MyST, an upgrade is usually resource intensive and risky. With MyST, an upgrade can be automated which significantly de-risks the upgrade process. This section primarily focuses on this type of upgrade. Upgrades can be either:\n\nSide-by-Side: also known as Out-of-place or Blue/Green\nor Direct: also known as In-place\n\n\n\nSide-By-Side Upgrades\nMost organizations, when migrating to Oracle SOA 12c or Oracle BPM 12c, choose to perform a side-by-side upgrade as it:\n\nrequires zero downtime\nsupports all SOA and BPM components\nallows for a phased migration\ninvolves significantly less risk\n\nThis involves provisioning a new instance of SOA/BPM 12c, replicating the configurations from your 11g platform and migrating and deploying your code. Once ready, you then switch over from 11g to 12c.\nMost organizations fail to maintain accurate documentation of their current 11g configurations, so have to manually reverse-engineer their existing 11g production configurations so they can be re-applied to their new 12c environments. This is both time consuming and error prone approach.\nMyST provides a simple and automated process for side-by-side upgrades. It allows administrators to introspect an existing 11g environment, extract the key configuration information and then use this to automatically provision an equivalent 12c environment in minutes.\nSide-By-Side Upgrades made Simple\nWhen performing a side-by-side upgrade, MyST will introspect the existing environment and create a corresponding 11g Platform Blueprint.\nNext, specify the Oracle Middleware version required. MyST will automatically convert the Platform Blueprint to one that is compliant with the Oracle Enterprise Deployment Guide, whilst preserving any custom configuration.\nFinally, specify the target environment(s) for the new upgraded domain. Then at the click of a button, MyST will automatically provision an equivalent upgraded Oracle Middleware platform.\nThe end-to-end process consists of three simple steps and can be performed in minutes as shown below.\nAlthough this example is for an 11g to 12c upgrade, the approach would be consistent for alternative version upgrades such as an upgrade from 12.1.3.0.0 to 12.2.1.0.0 or from 12.2.1.0.0 to 12.2.1.1.0.\n\nStep 1 - Introspect SOA / BPM 11gR1 Domain\nFor the purpose of this guide, we are going to introspect an existing Oracle SOA 11.1.1.7 environment running on two VMs, that consists of a 2 node SOA Cluster and 2 node OSB Cluster.\nThe steps for introspecting an existing Oracle SOA or BPM environment are documented in the chapter - Creating a Platform Blueprint from an Existing WebLogic Domain.\nIntrospection is only required if the environment to be upgraded was provisioned outside of MyST (e.g. by manual installation or another alternative method). If environment was built with MyST, the existing Platform Blueprint can be upgraded(as shown in the next step) rather than introspecting the environment first and creating one.\n\nStep 2 - Upgrade 11g Platform Blueprint to 12c\nThe next step is to upgrade the 11g SOA Platform Blueprint to create a new SOA 12c Platform Blueprint. From the side menu navigate to Modeling > Platform Blueprint, this will display a list of existing Platform Blueprints. Click on Create New in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will launch the New Platform Blueprint wizard.\n\nIn the initial dialogue, we need to specify the following details about the Platform Blueprint:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Platform Blueprint.\nDescription - A longer description of the Platform Blueprint.\nWorkspaces - This defines the Workspaces to which the Platform Blueprint belongs (Role Based Access Control allows administrators to manage which workspaces a user has access to.)\nInitial Version - Specifies the initial version of the Platform Blueprint, we will stick with the default.\n\nFinally, we need to specify how we want to create the Platform Blueprint, select the option to Upgrade from an existing blueprint and click Next.\nSpecify Oracle Middleware Upgrade Version\nNext, we need to specify the Platform Blueprint that we want to upgrade, so from the drop down select the introspected Platform Blueprint; Oracle SOA 11.1.1.7 in our example.\n\nNext, we need to select the version of Oracle SOA 12c we want to upgrade to, in our example we will upgrade to 12.2.1.0.0. Once done, click Next.\nReview the Summary\nMyST will display a screen showing the summary of the old Platform Blueprint that will be upgraded and the new Platform Blueprint that it will create in the process.\n\nWe can review these details. Once done, click Finish.\nView/Edit Platform Blueprint\nMyST will automatically convert our 11gR1 SOA Platform blueprint to an equivalent SOA 12c Platform Blueprint, whilst preserving the custom configurations that were previously applied to the 11g environment. This includes configurations such as JDBC Data Sources, File Stores, JMS Servers, JMS Modules, JCA Adapters and SAF Agents.\nOnce created, MyST will open the Platform Blueprint Editor where additional configuration changes can be made; for example, we may want to add in the Enterprise Scheduler Service that wasn't included in 11gR1.\n\nIf we look closely at the 12c Platform Blueprint, we can see that the number of Data Sources is different. In the 11g Platform Blueprint, there were 12 JDBC Data Sources but in the 12c Platform Blueprint, there are 15 JDBC Data Sources (see box 1 outlined in red above). This is because in SOA 12c, changes were made to database schemas and corresponding JDBC Data Sources required by the Oracle SOA Platform.\nWhen upgrading to 12c, MyST has the knowledge to remove the 11g data sources that are no longer needed and create the additional ones required for 12c. MyST has preserved the three custom data sources, which are colored white (as opposed to product data sources in light green) in the screenshot above.\nIn addition, when the SOA 11gR1 domain was originally created, the middleware version number was specified as part of the Domain Name, for example acme11g_domain. The corresponding directory locations Domain Home, Domain Aserver Home, etc, also have this in their file path (see box 2 outlined in red above).\n\nTo change this, place the Platform Blueprint into Edit mode and update the WebLogic Domain name to acme12c_domain and click Save.\nWe can see that MyST automatically updates all the other values that reference this property.\n\nWith this minor edit, we are now ready to provision the new 12c environment. Typically when migrating to 12c, we will want to create multiple non-production environments, such as DEV, SIT, UAT and PRE-PROD to test and validate that the migrated code is performing as expected before promoting into Production.\nWith MyST, we can use the same Platform Blueprint to provision all these environments, ensuring each environment is consistent with Production. For each environment we want to provision, we need to create a Platform Model. This essentially maps the Platform Blueprint to the target infrastructure and captures environment specific configuration details, such as credentials.\nStep 3 - Create Platform Model and Provision\nOnce we have finalized the migrated Platform Blueprint, the next step is to create a Platform Model and then use that to provision a Platform Instance. For more details on how to do this see Chapter 3.2 - Creating a Platform Model.\nDirect Upgrades\nA Direct Upgrade involves taking an existing platform including all of its configuration and migrating it directly. It does not have the many benefits of a Side-by-Side Upgrade and it will require a a longer outage.\nWhen to do a Direct Upgrade\nAs a general rule, Side-by-Side Upgrades are the safest and simplest type of upgrade to execute. However, there are some circumstances where a Direct Upgrade may be the only option.\n\nUnavailablity of hardware resources to maintain parallel environments.\nWhen we have a lot of model-specific settings in MyST Studio and want to avoid re-creating the Platform Models\nWhen our application is architected in a way that we are unable to do a side-by-side upgrade.\n\nWhen not to do a Direct Upgrade\nWe should avoid doing a Direct Upgrade\n\nWhen we want to be able to rollback immediately in the event of a failure.\nWhen we want to minimise downtime or avoid downtime altogether.\n\nTypes of Direct Upgrades\nThere are two types of Direct Upgrades:\n\nFresh: This involves terminating the current instance and then re-provisioning it on the new version. It is the safest type of Direct Upgrade as it relies on a standard Oracle installation rather than the in-place upgrade tools from Oracle which are less reliable and do not work in all cases.\nState-preserving: This is the riskiest type of upgrade but it has the benefit of preserving the long running state of existing deployed applications. If you want to perform a State-preserving upgrade with MyST we would recommend raising a support ticket.\n\nDirect Upgrades made Simple\nBefore performing a fresh direct upgrade, MyST will need to have existing Platform Blueprint and one or more Platform Models based off that.\nIf a Platform Blueprint and Models for your existing environments does not exist, we can introspect them using MyST.\nWhen performing a fresh direct upgrade for a platform instance, terminate the instance, update the version number within the Platform Blueprint then re-provision the instance.\nThe end-to-end process consists of two simple steps and can be performed in minutes.\nFor the purpose of this guide, we are going to upgrade an existing Oracle Service Bus 12.1.3 environment to 12.2.1 using a fresh direct upgrade approach.\nAlthough this example is for a 12.1.3 to 12.2.1 upgrade, the approach would be consistent for alternative version upgrades such as an upgrade of 11.1.1.7.0 to 12.1.3.0.0 or from 12.2.1.0.0 to 12.2.1.1.0.\n\nStep 1 - Upgrade 12.1.3.0.0 Platform Blueprint to 12.2.1.0.0\nSpecify Oracle Middleware Upgrade Version\nFrom the Blueprint Editor click Edit Configuration. Then, navigate to the Middleware Settings and click Edit in the Property Panel.\n\nChange the version to 12.2.1.0.0 and click Save in the Property Panel then Save for the Blueprint.\n\nView/Edit Platform Blueprint\nMyST will automatically convert the 12.1.3 Platform Blueprint to an equivalent 12.2.1 Platform Blueprint, whilst preserving the custom configuration that were previously applied to that environment. This includes configurations such as JDBC Data Sources, File Stores, JMS Servers, JMS Modules, JCA Adapters and SAF Agents.\nIf we look closely at our Platform Blueprint, we can see that there are some subtle differences. For example, if we are using the default Fusion Middleware Home Directory of /u01/app/oracle/product/fmw1213 we will see that it has changed to /u01/app/oracle/product/fmw1221.\nWarning\n\n\nIf a custom Home Directory under Middleware Settings is being used, this must be changed so that it is unique before performing an upgrade. For example, if it is set to /opt/my-company/12.1.3.0.0/soa, it should be changed to /opt/my-company/12.2.1.0.0/soa. Remember, a reference to the version ${[rxr.wls.Fmw-1].version} may be used e.g. /opt/my-company/${[rxr.wls.Fmw-1].version}/soa. If this property reference is already being used, then it would have changed the path automatically. Once the property reference is set within the Home Directory, it will update automatically for future upgrades. Make sure that any other property references to the version in the configuration which are hardcoded are using a reference, whilst it may not cause the upgrade to fail it will be a source of confusion for the upgraded platform. \nOnce the upgraded Platform Blueprint has been reviewed, click on Save & Commit. When prompted, enter a description for the change.\n\n\nWith these minor edits, we are now ready to upgrade our environments. Typically when upgrading, we will want to create multiple non-production environments, such as DEV, SIT, UAT and PRE-PROD to test and validate that the migrated code is performing as expected before promoting into Production. With MyST, we can use the same Platform Blueprint to upgrade all these environments, ensuring each environment is consistent with Production.\nStep 2 - Terminate and Re-provision the existing environment\nFrom the Actions menu for any Platform Instance, there is the option to Terminate. This will destroy the WebLogic Domain on the file system to allow for it to be upgraded. This approach is described in more detail in the section on Managing Platform Instances.\nWarning\n\n\nPlease be aware when this is performed, existing application state will be lost. Do not use this approach for an application architecture with long running processes. In this case, it is advisable to perform a State-preserving Upgrade which can be facilitated by raising a request to MyST Support.\n\nWhen ready to do a fresh direct upgrade to an instance associated with the upgraded Platform Blueprint, simply trigger the Terminate then perform a Reprovision.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/","title":"Platform Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Platform Configuration\nMyST's approach of using Platform Blueprints / Models to define the target state of our Oracle Middleware infrastructure allows us to automate not just the initial provisioning of the Oracle Middleware platform instance, but also its configuration.\nThis configuration can be applied, either as part of the initial provisioning of the platform instance or later by modifying Platform Blueprints / Model and performing an update action against the Platform Instances.\nThis section details how to define some of the more common Oracle Middleware configurations, such as:\n\nWebLogic Servers - For example, JTA Timeout, Server Startup Arguments and Classes.\nOracle Patches - To guarantee correct patch-levels\nJDBC Data Sources - With examples for Oracle RAC, Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2\nJava Messaging Service (JMS):\nPersistent Store Configuration\nJMS Modules, Queues and Topics\nStore and Forward (SAF) Services.\n\n\nJCA Adapters - Such as DB, JMS and File Adapters\nWork Managers - Such as constraint and request classes\nLoad Balancer Frontends - To ensure correct rewriting of server URLs\nWebtier Routing Rules - To define Oracle HTTP Server routings\nUsers, Groups, Roles and Policies - For advanced setting such as Role Conditions and Credential Maps\nKeystore Certificates - For apply certificates to keystores\nStartup and Shutdown Classes - To trigger custom startup or shutdown operations\nWebLogic Deployment Targeting - For targeting of default resources\n\n\nThis section only covers a subset of the configurations that can be performed by MyST. If the configuration you need to apply is not documented here, please raise a ticket at support.rubiconred.com to ask for assistance.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/","title":"WebLogic Servers","keywords":"","body":"WebLogic Servers\nThis chapter details how to define core WebLogic Server configurations, this includes:\n\nServer Start-Up Arguments\nServer Start-Up Classes\nJTA Timeout\n\nServer Startup Arguments\nServer Startup Arguments are used for providing arguments to the Java Virtual Machine for specific WebLogic Server instances. These are most commonly used for configuring memory settings. \nMyST makes it simple to configure the server startup arguments on a per-product basis. For Server Startup Arguments, MyST automatically generates a property under Global Variables for each product, with the naming convention .args. \nWhen we create our Platform Model, the WebLogic server instances are generated by MyST, which automatically reference the appropriate property. \n\nThis makes is easy to define a common property once to be used across a number of WebLogic Server instances in a cluster rather than managing each Server's properties separately like you would have to do when using the WebLogic Administration Console to do manual configuration.\n\nSo for example, if we have a SOA domain, containing both SOA and OSB, then MyST would generate the Global Variables osb.args and soa.argsas illustrated below.\n\nServer Startup Arguments defined with the convention .args are applied during start up by the WebLogic Node Manager. This is different to those defined with the convention .userMemArgs which are instead applied by manipulating the start-up scripts directly. \nDue to a WebLogic product constraint, the Admin Server arguments cannot be managed by the Node Manager. Thus Admin Server start-up arguments should be defined using the property admin.server.userMemArgs. MyST automatically does this for you by default (as illustrated above).\n\nIn 11g, Coherence cluster arguments were required to be defined under the server start arguments. As this is a complex and error-prone process, MyST Studio will automatically generate this for you when you have products in your Blueprint that use Coherence out of the box, such as SOA Suite. You don't have to worry about missing this step or making a mistake.\n\nConfigure Environment Specific Startup Arguments in the Platform Model\nIt's quite common to provide fewer resources to a Development or Testing environment compared to Production. As a result, these environments often require different memory settings.\nMyST makes it simple to override the startup arguments defined in the Platform Blueprint by configuring environment specific Startup arguments in our Platform Model\n. \nTo do this, navigate to the Global Variables within the Platform Model. By default, MyST will show the start-up arguments inherited from the Platform Blueprint. To override these simply edit the values as required within the Platform Model.\n\nWe also have the option of overriding the startup arguments when we first create the Platform Model by specifying these on the Advanced tab of the Platform Model Configuration override stage of the Platform Model wizard.\n\nStartup and Shutdown Classes\nWebLogic allows us to configure startup and shutdown classes in order to perform tasks when we start up or gracefully shut down the server. \nTo add start-up and shutdown classes to the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > Startup & Shutdown Classes.\n\nTo add a Startup or Shutdown Class, click on the corresponding + symbol. This will create a new Startup/Shutdown Class; Startup Class - 1 in the example below.\n\nFor each Startup/Shutdown Class we need to specify the following properties:\n\nName - An alpha-numeric value that identifies the startup class configuration. This name attribute is for your identification purposes only.\n\nTarget - The cluster to which the class is to be deployed. It is recommended that the target be defined as a MyST property reference rather than a direct value.\n\nClass Name - Fully qualified name of the Java class.\n\nDeployment Order - Determines order in which classes are loaded and executed. Items with the lowest Deployment Order value are loaded first. Priority is relative to other deployable items of the same type.\n\nArguments - Arguments that the WebLogic server uses to initialize a class. Multiple arguments must be separated by a comma. For example attribute1=value1,attribute2=value2\n\n\nBy default WebLogic Server startup classes are run after the server initializes JMS and JDBC services, and after applications and stand-alone modules have been deployed and activated. We can modify this behavior by configuring the following properties:\n\nLoad Before App Deployments - Causes the targeted servers to load and run a startup class before it activates JMS and JDBC services and before it starts deployment for applications and EJBs.\n\nLoad Before App Activation - Causes the targeted servers to load and run a startup class before it activates applications and EJBs.\n\n\n\nNote: The startup or shutdown class must be on the classpath of each server to which it is assigned. See Application Blueprints for further details.\n\nConfigure JTA Timeout\nTo set the JTA Timeout in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name].\nClick Edit and enable advanced properties for the component. Scroll to the bottom of the component edit view and update the MyST Extension with the following snippet:\n\n    300\n\nSet the TimeoutSeconds attribute to the required value. Once done your settings for the [domain_name] component should look something like:\n\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/patches/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/patches/","title":"Oracle Patches","keywords":"","body":"Oracle Patches\nOracle often provides patches for their products. These patches can be applied through a utility provided by Oracle known as OPatch. MyST Studio has full support for applying these Oracle patches. This can be done by defining patches directly in the Platform Blueprint.\n\nNote: Prior to 12c, WebLogic patches were not applied by OPatch and were instead done through a tool called BSU. MyST Studio has support for both OPatch and BSU allowing patching for any of the products in the 11g and 12c product families.\n\nBefore MyST Studio can apply patches, they need to be first downloaded from My Oracle Support. Once downloaded, patches should be made available for consumption by MyST Studio. One common approach for doing this is to place the patches on a software share that is made available to all target hosts. This is the approach that we will take.\nAdd Patch to Platform Blueprint\nHow you apply a patch depends on whether you are patching an Oracle Middleware 11g or 12c instance:\n\nOracle Middleware 11g - Oracle patches are applied on a per-product basis. This means that in the MyST Studio blueprint editor, you would define the patches under the specific product being patched. \n\nOracle Middleware 12c - Oracle patches are applied globally for all of Oracle Middleware rather than on a per product basis. For that reason, in 12c, it is recommended to define patches under Oracle WebLogic as a convention.\n\n\nTo add a patch to the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint in Edit mode and navigate to Blueprint > Products  > Oracle WebLogic.\nWith the Component in edit mode, locate the Patch List and click on + Add Item. \n\nThis will add a new Patch to the Patch List. For each Patch we need to specify the following properties:\n\nPatch Id - The patch id provided by Oracle that identifies the patch.\nFile - The absolute path to the file that contains the Patch.\nDescription - Free format text field that explains the purpose of the patch\n\n\nOnce done click Save.\n\nApplying the Patch to a Platform Instance\nIf the patch is added to the Platform Blueprint prior to provisioning the Platform Instance then the patch will be automatically applied as part of the provisioning process. \nIf the Platform Instance has already been provisioned then we will need to apply the patch. For details on how to do this, see the section on Patching a Platform Instance\n in Chapter 3.6 - Managing Platform Instances for further details.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/jdbc/":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/jdbc/","title":"Data Sources (JDBC)","keywords":"","body":"Data Sources (JDBC)\nConfiguring JDBC Data Sources in MyST is a two stage process. \n\nFirst, define the Data Source in the Platform Blueprint. Here we define the common and default configuration details for the Data Source. \nSecond, define the environment specific details in each of the Platform Models, for example the database URL and connection credentials.\n\nConfiguring Data Source in Platform Blueprint\nAdd Data Source to Platform Blueprint\nTo add a new data source in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > JDBC Data Sources. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources.\nClick on the + icon next to JDBC Data Sources (outlined in red). This will create a new Data Source, Jdbc Data Source - 13 in the example below.\n\nNote: An alternative way of creating a new Data Source is to select an existing data source, right click on it and select Clone.\n\n\nSelect the new data source in the tree view, MyST will display its current configuration. Initially, none of its properties will be set. Click Edit to put the Data Source into edit mode and enter the required values as detailed in JDBC Data Source Properties.\nEdit Data Source in Platform Blueprint\nTo edit an existing data source in the Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > JDBC Data Sources. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources and select the data source you wish to edit.\nClick Edit to put the Data Source into edit mode and enter the required values as detailed in JDBC Data Source Properties.\nDelete Data Source from Platform Blueprint\nTo delete an existing data source from a Platform Blueprint, open the Platform Blueprint Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > JDBC Data Sources. \nExpand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources. Select an existing data source, right click on it and select Delete.\nJDBC Data Source Properties\nThis section details all the properties that we can set for a JDBC data source in the MyST platform blueprint. To see all properties that are available, ensure Show advanced properties has been enabled as illustrated below.\n\nThe majority of these properties are optional. If a property is Not Set then MyST will not set that property when configuring a data source, meaning WebLogic will use the default value.\nThe following section below details each of these properties. It should be noted that most properties are of type String. Where this is not the case, the type is indicated. Property values of type password are automatically encrypted by MyST.\nComponent Properties\nFor each JDBC data source we need to specify the following component properties:\n\nName - Enter a name for this JDBC data source.\n\nType - The type of data source. Supported types are generic, multi or gridlink. This value defaults to generic.\n\nTarget - Comma-separated list of JDBC target, which can be either the ServerName or the ClusterName. It is recommended that the target be defined as a MyST property reference rather than a direct value. For example ${[rxr.wls.Cluster-1].name}.\n\nUsername - User name used to connect to the database. This may or may not be a generic value. If it changes per environment then you do not need to set it in your Platform Blueprint.\n\n\nJdbc Data Source Params\nUnder Jdbc Data Source Params we can specify the following properties:\n\nJNDI Name - Enter the JNDI path to where this JDBC data source will be bound.\n\nGlobal Transactions Protocol - Use this property to enable non-XA connections from the data source to participate in global transactions.\n\nAlgorithm Type - Use this property only when using Multidatasource. The algorithm type defines whether you want an active-active (load balancing) or an active-passive (failover) configuration. Supported types are Load-Balancing or Failover.\n\nData Sources - Use this only when using Multidatasource. Comma-separated list of data sources. If the Algorithm Type is set to Failover, the connection request is sent to the first data source in this list. In case the connection fails, the request is sent to the next data source in this list.\n\nFailover Request If Busy - Use this only when using Multidatasource and if the Algorithm Type is set to Failover. Set this property to true if you want to failover the connection request to the next data source if all the connections in the active data source are in busy. Type: Boolean (true or false)\n\n\nJdbc Driver Params\nUnder Jdbc Driver Params we need to specify the following properties:\n\nUrl - The JDBC connection URL. \n\nDriver Name - The fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver class used to create the physical database connections. Ensure that this driver class supports the transaction behavior you have configured in Global Transactions Protocol.\n\nPassword - The password used to connect to the database. This should be unique per environments, so should be specified in the Platform Model.\n\nName-Value Parameters - Optional list of properties passed to the JDBC driver. Use this to pass property values that are not defined in MyST. For each property we need to define the following attributes:\n\nKey - The property id\nValue - The property value\n\n\n\nJdbc Connection Pool Params\nUnder Jdbc Connection Pool Params we can specify the following properties (if not specified WebLogic will use default values):\n\nCapacity Increment - The number of additional connections created when new connections are added to the connection pool. Type: Integer\n\nConnection Creation Retry Frequency Seconds - The number of seconds between attempts to establish connections to the database. Type: Integer\n\nInitial Capacity - The minimum number of physical connections to create when creating the connection pool. Type: Integer\n\nMin Capacity - The minimum number of physical connections that this connection pool maintains. Type: Integer\n\nMax Capacity - The maximum number of physical connections that this connection pool can contain. Type: Integer\n\nTest Frequency Seconds - The number of seconds between when WebLogic Server tests unused connections. Requires that you specify a Test Table Name. Connections that fail the test are closed and reopened to re-establish a valid physical connection. If the test fails again, the connection is closed. When set to 0, periodic testing is disabled. Type: Integer\n\nTest Connections On Reserve - Enables WebLogic Server to test a connection before giving it to a client. Requires that you specify a Test Table Name. Type: Boolean (true or false)\n\nTest Table Name - The name of the database table to use when testing physical database connections. This name is required when you specify a Test Frequency and enable Test Reserved Connections.\n\nRemove Infected Connections - When set to true (which is the default value), the physical connection is not returned to the connection pool after the application closes the logical connection. Instead, the physical connection is closed and recreated. When set to false, when the application closes the logical connection, the physical connection is returned to the connection pool and can be reused by the application or by another application. Type: Boolean (true or false)\n\nSeconds To Trust An Idle Pool Connection - The number of seconds within a connection use that WebLogic server trusts that the connection is still viable and will skip the connection test, either before delivering it to an application or during the periodic connection testing process. Type: Integer\n\n\nJdbc Oracle Params\nUnder Jdbc Oracle Params we can specify the following properties:\n\nFan Enabled - Applicable only to RAC configurations. Type: Boolean (true or false)\n\nOns Nodes - JDBC Oracle parameters for ONS client configuration.\n\n\nConfigure environment specific properties in Platform Model\nFor each Platform Model we need to define the environment specific values for each Data Source, this typically comprises the following properties:\n\nUrl - This is the URL for the database that we want our Data Source to connect to.\n\nUsername - User name used to connect to the database.\n\nPassword - The password used to connect to the database.\n\n\nWhen it comes to defining the Url and Username, one option is to use MyST properties to minimize the number of specific property values we need to define within the Platform Model.\nFor example, we could define username as \nUsername = ${[rxr.def.Product-rcu].param[db-user-prefix]}_STOCK\nThe RCU prefix defined in the Platform Model will then be prepended to _STOCK to create the Username. So for example if the RCU prefix was ACI we would get the username ACI_STOCK.\n\nIn addition, if we are creating multiple data sources against the same database, another option is to define a global variable in the Platform Blueprint, for example stockDb.Url which we can then reference in each Data Source that connects to that database as follows:\nUrl = ${var.stockDb.Url}\nWe will, of course, need to set the value of stockDb.Url in the Platform Model, but would only need to set this once, irrespective of how many data sources referenced this.\nIn addition, we may want to override other settings in the Platform Blueprint as they may differ between environments. For example, we may have smaller connection pools or only be using Oracle RAC in Pre-Prod and Prod.\nTo edit a data source in the Platform Model, open the Platform Model Editor and navigate to Blueprint > WebLogic Domains > [domain_name] > JDBC Data Sources. Expand this component to see a list of currently defined data sources and select the data source you wish to edit.\nAny values you enter here will override the corresponding value in the Platform Model. Once done, click Save to save these values within the Data Source and then click Save & Commit to save the Platform Model and commit our changes.\nExample JDBC Data Source Configurations\nThe following section contains example JDBC Data Source configurations for:\n\nOracle Database\nOracle RAC\nIBM DB2\nMicrosoft SQL Server\n\nCreating a JDBC Data Source for Oracle Database\nBelow is an example configuration for an Oracle DB data source.

MyST Studio groups configuration for all of these objects under Work Manager Configuration.\n\nThe first displayed entry is Work Managers, but because work managers refer to most other object types, we'll come back to those in a moment.\nConfiguring Response Time Request Classes\nResponse Time Request Classes are used to indicate that a given request should be processed within an ideal timeframe, which is expressed in milliseconds. It's important to note that this is not the response time experienced by a client application or end user, but the response time for an individual item of work performed by a server-side component.\n\nTo create a response time request class in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Request Classes > Response Time\nClick + to the right of Response Time to add a new response time request class\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a response time request class, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name displayed for the request class in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the request class\n\nTarget - the server the request class will be targeted to\n\nGoal - ideal response time expressed in milliseconds\n\n\nConfiguring Fair Share Request Classes\nFair Share Request Classes are used to indicate the percentage of available threads that should be allocated to work during periods where all available worker threads are in use.\n\nTo create a fair share request class in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Request Classes > Fair Share\nClick + to the right of Fair Share to add a new fair share request class\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a fair share request class, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the request class in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the request class\n\nTarget - the server the request class will be targeted to\n\nFair Share - the percentage or weighting allocated to work requests using this request class\n\n\nConfiguring Context Request Classes\nContext Request Classes are used to provide specific resource allocation behavior to requests performed under a particular identity context. The behavior of context request classes is determined by individual context cases, each of which specifies either a user or group context, and a specific request class to use for that identity context.\n\nTo create a context request class in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Request Classes >  Context\nClick + to the right of Context to add a new context request class\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a context request class, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the request class in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the request class\nTarget - the server the request class will be targeted to\n\nConfiguring Context Cases\nContext Cases encapsulate how individual identity contexts are treated by a context request class.\nTo create a context case in MyST Studio, click the + Add Item button to the right of Context Case List\n\nTo configure a context case, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the context case in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the context case\nEither User Name or Group Name to indicate the identity context the context case will manage requests for\nRequest Class Name - the name of another configured request class (either Fair Share or Response Time Request Class) used to manage requests under the defined identity context\n\nConfiguring Maximum Thread Constraints\nMaximum Thread Constraints are used primarily to avoid deadlock situations in server processing due to all available threads being allocated to one component when processing requests involving multiple server-side components overall. They are also used to prevent upstream congestion from consuming expensive resources while waiting for limited backend components to complete processing.\n\nTo create a maximum thread constraint in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Constraints > Maximum Threads\nClick + to the right of Maximum Threads to add a new maximum threads constraint\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a maximum thread constraint, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the constraint in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the constraint\nTarget - the server the constraint will be targeted to\nCount - the maximum number of threads allocated to work managed by this constraint\nData Source - can be used instead of Count to size the total number of threads allocated to work based on the maximum size of the specified data source connection pool. Particularly useful for any database connection-bound work.\n\nConfiguring Minimum Thread Constraints\nMinimum Thread Constraints are used to help avoid deadlock situations in server processing due to all available threads being allocated to one component when processing requests involving multiple server-side components overall. They are also used to indicate prioritization in situations where all available worker threads are allocated to performing work.\n\nTo create a minimum thread constraint in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Constraints > Minimum Threads\nClick + to the right of Minimum Threads to add a new minimum threads constraint\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a minimum thread constraint, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the constraint in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the constraint\nTarget - the server the constraint will be targeted to\nCount - the minimum number of threads allocated to work managed by this constraint\n\nCapacity Constraints\nCapacity Constraints are used to provide a guide for how many requests the server should allow to be queued waiting for worker threads before rejecting incoming requests.\n\nTo create a capacity constraint in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Constraints > Capacity.\nClick + to the right of Capacity to add a new context request class\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a capacity constraint, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the constraint in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the constraint\nTarget - the server the constraint will be targeted to\nCount - the number of requests to allow to be queued for processing before beginning to reject incoming requests for work\nData Source - can be used instead of Count to size the queue of incoming requests for work based on the maximum size of the specified data source connection pool. \n\nConfiguring Work Managers\nWork Managers are the higher level components that make use of all of these request classes and constraints to encapsulate a complex set of performance behaviors at runtime. Work Managers are the objects referred to by application configuration to indicate preferred behavior for allocating and managing resources for performing work at runtime.\n\nTo create a work manager in MyST Studio:\n\nNavigate to WebLogic Domains > [domain name] > Work Manager Configuration > Work Managers\nClick + to the right of Work Managers to add a new work manager\nClick the Edit button above the table of properties\n\nTo configure a work manager, the following must be provided:\n\nName - the name used for the work manager in the WebLogic Admin Console, and used in any configuration referring to the constraint\nTarget - the server the work manager will be targeted to\n\nThe following properties may be provided:\n\nWhenever an object's ID is referred to, this is the identifier used to indicate an object in the tree view structure of the model or blueprint. This may be the same as the Name property of an object or may be completely different.\n\n\nRequest Class Id - the ID of a Response Time Request Class, Fair Share Request Class or Context Request Class used by the work manager\n\nMinimum Threads Constraint Id - the ID of a Minimum Threads Constraint used by the work manager\n\nMaximum Threads Constraint Id - the ID of a Maximum Threads Constraint used by the work manager\n\nCapacity Constraint Id - the ID of a Capacity Constraint used by the work manager\n\nStuck Thread Action - action to perform once a thread is detected as stuck\n\nMax Thread Stuck Time - time after which a thread is considered stuck by the work manager\n\nStuck Thread Count - total number of stuck threads permitted by the work manager before it is shut down\n\nIgnore Stuck Threads - whether the work manager should ignore stuck threads\n\n\nFor more information on the configuration of work managers, refer to Oracle's MBean documentation.\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/load-balancer-configuration.html":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/load-balancer-configuration.html","title":"Load Balancer","keywords":"","body":"Load Balancer\nThe load balancer helps you bring in redundancy and distribute workload across your servers. Add this configuration if you want to include a load balancer in your configuration.\nMyST supports the definition of a load balancer to ensure that server URLs are correctly re-written to route through the load balancer. If you have blocked direct access (i.e. not via a load balancer) from the corporate network to your server instances (which is a generally a recommended good practice) then the setting of the load balancer will be mandatory otherwise you will find that URLs you expect to be able to access will get blocked.\nA load balancer definition in MyST can have many frontend definitions. A frontend represents a host and port combination. If you are providing access from the load balancer front-end over HTTP or HTTPS you should set its port (typically this is 80 for HTTP and HTTPS 443). If you are not providing access to a given port from the load balancer frontend you should set the port to 0 to prevent the server URLs being re-written to route to this protocol erroneously.\nSome of the parameters for the frontend, such as the host, are environment-specific and need not be specified in a blueprint. In this case, you can enter the value \"?\" for these parameters, and define them in your platform model. MyST will validate that you have defined this value in your platform model at the time of a platform update or provision. When you define the same parameters in your platform model, the values provided in the platform model will take precedence over the values provided in the platform blueprint.\nCreating a frontend entry\nSetting up a load balancer frontend in your platform blueprint requires you to set the following properties.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nThe load-balancer ID used to reference the frontend when defining clusters and managed servers.\n\n\nHost\nThe frontend host's address.\n\n\nHttp Port\nThe frontend host's HTTP address.\n\n\nHttps Port\nThe frontend host's HTTPS address.\n\n\n\nFrom the Edit mode in a Platform Blueprint navigate to the Frontend List within Load Balancer and click Add Item.\nEnter an identifier for the Frontend. This is an important part of the definition as the identifier will be used to reference our frontend from given clusters or servers. Through the targeting to a frontend to a cluster or server we tell WebLogic to ensure all URLs are re-written back through this host and port(s).\n\nIn our example above we have set the identifier to fmw. This is a special identifier. When we set it to this, MyST will automatically set the frontend for every cluster and the admin server to be the fmw frontend. This saves you time in manually targeting but should be avoided if you require different frontends per cluster (e.g. soa.mycompany.com for SOA Suite Cluster and osb.mycompany.com for Oracle Service Bus Cluster).\n"},"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/web-tier.html":{"url":"platform/resources/weblogic/servers/web-tier.html","title":"Webtier Routing Rules","keywords":"","body":"Webtier Routing Rules\nThe Oracle Webtier (also known as Oracle HTTP Server) provides the interface between your external load balancer and the applications. This topic helps you understand the basic configuration parameters for Oracle Web Tier that you can define in the platform blueprint. The WebTier configuration is optional, and you can add it only when you need WebTier in your configuration.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin defining the configuration, the Webtier must be listed as a product in your Platform Blueprint.\nIf you did not select Oracle Webtier during the Platform Blueprint Wizard then you can add it your Blueprint at a later stage as follows:\nFrom the Edit mode in a Platform Blueprint navigate to the Products component and click on + icon to add a new product.\n\nYou will then be prompted to select the product to compute group targeting.

To simplify this, there is a property that is dynamically created at runtime, which can be used to automatically retrieve this list of server addresses. This property is core.webtier.cluster\\[CLUSTER-ID\\].server-addresses. At run time, it will automatically create the server list as above without the need to explicitly define all the listen-address and listen-port elements of the servers in the cluster.\n\n> Note: When you enable root permissions through the flag core.product\\[webtier\\].param\\[root-permissions-enabled\\], it is assumed that the operating system group which owns the home defined by core.product\\[webtier\\].home is \"oracle\".

It has become the default build tool for Oracle Middleware.\nMaven addresses two aspects of the build process; first, it describes how to build the software, and second, it describes any build time dependencies.\nThe Project Object Model or POM is an XML File that provides all the configuration information required by Maven for the build, such as the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. \nFor each artifact that we wish to build, we need to create a corresponding POM file. Once created, we need to commit that to our Version Control System so that we can perform automated builds from our CI Server.\nPopulating Binary Repository with Maven plugin\nThe Oracle Maven Synchronization plugin supports populating local and remote repositories with artifacts from a given Oracle Middleware installation. Detailed instructions are available in the Oracle documentation on how to setup your Binary repository. \nYou must perform the one-off synchonization step in your local environment or Continuous Integration server before you can build Oracle SOA and related artifacts using Maven.\n\nSample commands are shown below. \nSeeding a local repository\nThis is useful for a basic local build setup.\nUpdate the values of ORACLE_HOME to suit the target environment.\nexport ORACLE_HOME=/opt/app/oracle/product/fmw1221\n\nmvn install:install-file \\\n-Dfile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.jar \\\n-DpomFile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.pom\n\nmvn com.oracle.maven:oracle-maven-sync:push \\\n-DoracleHome=${ORACLE_HOME} -DtestingOnly=false\nSeeding a remote repository\nThis approach is recommended for a Continuous Integration server and/or a team of developers. When a build is run on any server with the same Maven settings.xml the required libraries will be automatically downloaded if they are missing.\nUpdate the values of ORACLE_HOME, and MAVEN_SERVER to suit the target environment. Note: This command could take up to 2 hours to complete, depending on network performance.\nexport ORACLE_HOME=/opt/app/oracle/product/fmw1221\n\nmvn deploy:deploy-file \\\n-Dfile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.jar \\\n-DpomFile=${ORACLE_HOME}/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.2.1/oracle-maven-sync-12.2.1.pom \\\n-Durl=http://${MAVEN_SERVER}:8081/artifactory/ext-release-local/ -DrepositoryId=artifactory\n\nmvn com.oracle.maven:oracle-maven-sync:push \\\n-DoracleHome=${ORACLE_HOME} -DtestingOnly=false -DserverId=artifactory\nFor the above to work, you should define your Maven Repository connection details in the Maven settings.xml. Below is an example for Artifactory.\n\n\n      \n      \n      admin  \n      password  \n      artifactory  \n      \n  \n  \n    \n      oracle-repo              \n      \n         /opt/app/oracle/product/fmw1221\n      \n              \n        \n          artifactory\n          artifactory\n          http://localhost:8081/artifactory/ext-release-local\n          default\n          \n             false\n          \n          \n            never\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    oracle-repo\n  \n\n\nDefining our Project Object Model\nEach automated Maven build should have a Project Object Model (also knows as pom) which is defined in a pom.xml file at the project root directory.\nAt a minimum a pom.xml must contain a groupId, artifactId and version (also known as a GAV classifier) and a modelVersion to indicate the version of the Maven Project Object Model itself. At the time of writing, 4.0.0 is the latest pom version.\nBelow is an example of the most minimal pom.xml to create a single jar file\n\n 4.0.0\n com.acme\n my-jar-achive\n 1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nGiven this pom.xml and a source code structure as follows...\nhello-world\n├── pom.xml\n└── src\n    └── main\n        └── java\n            └── com\n                └── acme\n                    └── hello_world\n                        └── Main.java\n\n6 directories, 2 files\n...when I navigate to the hello-world project directory from a Terminal and execute mvn package then a Java Archive will be compiled and packaged to target/hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nMaven Parents\nMaven supports the concept of project inheritance. This can be useful when you want to have a common set of properties and plugins that are reused by multiple projects. This is also the mechanism that Oracle use to enable a given pom.xml to build a certain project type. \nProject inheritance is achieved through the concept of a Parent POM which is in-turn referenced by the Project POM. Below is an example pom.xml for building an Oracle Service Bus (OSB) archive for the 12.2.1.0.0 version of Oracle SOA Suite.\n\n\n  4.0.0\n  \n    com.oracle.servicebus\n    sbar-project-common\n    12.1.3-0-0\n  \n  com.acme\n  stock-services\n  1.0-SNAPSHOT\n  sbar\n\nIn addition to the automated build, the MyST build plugin will use the parent for Oracle-specific artifacts to determine the deploy-time Artifact Type. This is important as MyST uses different deploy-time strategies depending on the Artifact Type.\nThe below table contains the details of common Parent POMs provided by Oracle and their corresponding MyST Artifact Type.\n\n\n\nMyST Artifact Type\nGroup ID\nArtifact ID\nSupport Versions\n\n\n\n\nADF\ncom.oracle.adf\nadf-parent\n12.1.3-0-0, 12.2.1-0-0\n\n\nSOA/BPM Composites\ncom.oracle.soa\nsar-common\n12.1.3-0-0, 12.2.1-0-0\n\n\nOSB Configuration\ncom.oracle.servicebus\nsbar-project-common\n12.1.3-0-0, 12.2.1-0-0\n\n\n\nJDeveloper Examples\nOracle JDeveloper 12c has native support for Apache Maven.\nBuilding Oracle Service Bus Projects in JDeveloper with Maven\nIn this section, we provide a detailed walkthrough on how to create a POM file in JDeveloper. In this example, we will show how to create a POM file for an OSB project. A similar approach would also be used for other artifact types.\nWithin JDeveloper, locate the OSB project that we wish to build with Maven. Right click on the project and click New and then select From Gallery.\n\nType pom into the Search Bar and then select Empty POM (Maven).\n\nClick OK. JDeveloper will open the Create a Maven POM dialogue. Leave the defaults when prompted to enter the location and click Ok.\n\nIf prompted to overwrite an existing file, select Yes.\n\nJDeveloper will then prompt us to enter the following values:\n\nGroup Id: The groupId for your new project. This usually starts with your organization's domain name in reverse format. For example com.acme.\nArtifact Id: The artifactId for your OSB project. This is usually an identifier for this project.\nVersion: The version for our OSB project. This is usually 1.0-SNAPSHOT for a new project.\nPackaging - This must be set to sbar\nParent > Group Id - This must be set to com.oracle.servicebus.\nParent > Artifact Id - This must be set to sbar-project-common.\nParent > Version - This must be set to the version of the Oracle Service Bus, for example, 12.1.3-0-0 or 12.2.1-0-0.\n\n\nClick on the Source tab. The source should look similar to the following:\n\n\n    4.0.0\n    com.acme\n    StockServices\n    1.0-SNAPSHOT\n    sbar\n    \n        com.oracle.servicebus\n        sbar-project-common\n        12.2.1-0-0\n    \n\nOnce completed, save the POM.\n\nWhen creating a POM for a different artifact type, we will need to specify the appropriate packaging and parent groupId, artifactId and version. For further details, refer to the Oracle Documentation.\n\nTest Maven Build\nPrior to configuring our CI Server to automatically executing our Maven build, it is good practice to test that we have correctly configured our POM file by executing the Maven build from within JDeveloper.\nRight-click on the project and click Run Maven then package.\n\nWe should see the Maven build running in the Apache Maven - package tab.\n Once the build has completed successfully, the output should look similar to the following.\n\nNavigate to the folder .data/maven on the file system under the project home. You should see a file created called sbconfig.sbar.\n\nOnce we have created our Project Object Model (pom.xml). We must commit it to our Version Control System so that we can perform automated builds from our CI Server.\n\n"},"build/ci/":{"url":"build/ci/","title":"Configuring Automated Builds ","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Automated Builds\nThe build process is orchestrated by a Continuous Integration (CI) Server, such as Jenkins, TeamCity or Bamboo.

In Item Name enter an appropriate name for our Maven build job. Next select Maven project as job type.\n\nClick OK.\nSpecify Source Code Location\nUnder Source Code Management select your source code repository type (such as  Subversion or Git). For the URL, enter the full path to the JDeveloper project directory in our source code repository.\n\nWe can leave all the other fields with default values.\n\nWhen checking out an Oracle OSB project we need to specify the project's parent directory, this is due to a constraint with the Oracle OSB Maven build which needs to take the deployment URI from the parent directory. \nThis means, when Jenkins checks out the project, by default it will look for the POM file in the parent directory, so we need to specify the relative path to the POM file in the project sub-directory.\n\nConfigure Build Triggers\nUnder Build Triggers tick Poll SCM and enter the schedule, for example, a schedule of H/10 * * * * means to poll every ten minutes.\nAdd Pre-Build Step\nClick on Add pre-build step and then select Invoke top-level Maven targets\nSelect Maven as the Maven Version and enter the following into the Goals field:\nbuild-helper:parse-version versions:set '-DnewVersion=${parsedVersion.majorVersion}.${parsedVersion.minorVersion}-${BUILD_NUMBER}'\nThis tells Maven to always append the build number to the artifact version.\n\nClick on Advanced... below the step.

Metadata files created during design time in JDeveloper are referenced from MDS at run time by these applications.\nWhere MDS artifacts containing environment specific values are being manually deployed, these values must be modified at source before each deployment. This approach is not practical for continuous integration.\nA common solution is to create sets of Ant/Maven scripts, and search and replace values of these files before deployment by looking up environment specific values defined in property files. This approach provides an improvement over the manual approach, but a number of issues remain, namely:\n\nThere is a risk that non-centralized property files and values will be copied and pasted around, increasing the risk of configuration drift over time.\nThis type of bespoke build and deploy scripting tends to grow more complex and less maintainable over time.\nThere is a significant ongoing effort involved in bringing custom scripting to a robust level of usability.\n\nThe ideal MDS deployment solution should overcome all of the above issues, and MyST Late Binding from MyST Studio does exactly that.\nApplying MyST Late Binding \nMyST Late Binding involves tokenizing files with MyST data model property references which will be de-referenced and expanded to their corresponding data values during  deployment (ie after build and initial packaging).\nDuring deployment, MyST Late Binding expands the MDS jar/zip file, and performs a MyST property search and replace on *.ep.wsdl, *.wsdl and *.xml files with environment specific values obtained from the MyST engine; it re-packages the files back into the MDS archive file, and performs deployment to import metadata to MDS runtime server.\nSteps \nThe following steps are required to achieve MDS customization using MyST Late Binding found in MyST Studio:\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio.\nUpdate MDS metadata source files with MyST property references.

A Configuration Plan is an xml document generated from a SOA composite.xml using JDeveloper or the WLST scripting tool.\nA configuration plan, when applied during deployment via JDeveloper or Oracle supplied Ant script, can modify the content of files within a SOA application, hence the SOA application is tailored for the target environment, such as Production.\nSOA configuration plans support customization of the composite file (composite.xml), any wsdl imported from composite.xml (.wsdl), any xml schema file (.xsd) and JCA adapter files (.jca).\nHowever, there are limitations to what can be changed by configuration plan, only certain properties and attributes can be modified. For detail please see: Deploying SOA Composite Applications - 11g Release 1 (11.1.1.6.3). For any environment value tokenization that cannot be achieved via SOA configuration plan, you can always apply MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This will be discussed shortly.\nIn a SOA project, typically developers generate one configuration plan from the composite.xml, then tailor the configuration plan for the target environment, or make various copies of the plan file. The maintenance of multiple configuration plans can be a nightmare. Firstly, the endpoint values are hard coded into the configuration plans. When an endpoint changes, developers must refactor that endpoint in all configuration plans across all affected SOA projects.\nA better solution common in continuous integration is to write custom Ant/Maven scripts to automatically search and replace a single configuration plan per SOA project. This approach provides an improvement over the first approach, but a number of issues similar to those discussed for custom MDS deployment scripts remain.\nThe ideal SOA deployment solution:\n\nshould maintain only a single configuration plan.\ndoes not require manual maintenance of property values across potentially numerous SCAs.\nshould be a common and standardized solution across application tiers. \n\nMyST Late Binding from MyST Studio fulfills the above requirements.\nApplying MyST Late Binding on SOA Configuration Plan File \nWith MyST Studio, only a single configuration plan is required per SOA project regardless of the number of environments, and this is achieved by MyST property late binding. During deployment, MyST will expand the SOA jar/zip file, and perform a MyST property search and replace on *.ep.wsdl, *.wsdl and *.xml files with environment specific values obtained from the MyST engine; it then packages the files back into the SOA archive file and performs deployment.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply an SOA configuration plan with MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn each SOA project, generate a configuration plan from the SOA composite.xml file and named it \"cfgplan.xml\".\n\nModify the configuration plan to replace any environment specific detail with MyST property references.\n\nAdd any missing configuration in the configuration plan.\n\nCreate an SOA build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful SOA builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun SOA Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan \nIf the standard SOA configuration plan is not sufficient for your particular use case, you can apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This solution can update any file in the SOA project. Fortunately, generic configuration plan only requires minimal configuration effort.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan to an SOA deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn your file system, create a generic configuration plan file called myst-config-plan.xml. An example is given below. For detail see MyST Generic Configuration Plans\n\nPut this file under the META-INF folder in the SOA project's root directory.\n\nCreate an SOA build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful SOA builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun SOA Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nOSB Customization \nThis section provides details on customizing OSB projects with MyST Studio.\nThere are two customizations that can be applied for customizing OSB projects against the target environment, these are:\n\nApplying MyST Late Binding on OSB Customization File\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan\n\nApplying MyST Late Binding on OSB Customization File \nCustomization of common OSB values, including environment values, operational settings, and reference mappings, can be achieved by using an OSB customization file. In 11g this customization file is called ALSBCustomizationFile.xml; in 12c it is called OSBCustomizationFile.xml. For details please see the Oracle documentation: Customizing Oracle Service Bus Environments.\nIn many Oracle middleware projects, developers generate an OSB customization file from the OSB console on a given environment, eg TEST. They will then make a copy of the generated (TEST) configuration file for the other target environments and customize those copies accordingly (eg for UAT, PREPROD, PROD). In other words, there is a customization file to be maintained per environment/project combination.\nThis approach generally works fine, but it requires maintenance for each environment. For example, if there are five environments and 20 OSB projects, 100 customization files must be maintained in a project.\nThe solution to this problem is to maintain only 1 customization file per OSB project regardless of the number of environments .\nInstead of keeping environment specific values in the environment specific customization files, MyST Studio maintains these values in the Platform Models. In the OSB customization file, the environment specific values must be replaced with MyST property references. The benefit of this tokenization is that only a single OSB customization file needs to be maintained.\nDuring deployment, MyST Late Binding will expand the OSB jar file and perform a MyST property search and replace on OSB customization files with environment specific values obtained from the MyST engine; it packages the files back into the OSB archive file, and finally import OSB projects to OSB server.\nThe major advantage of this approach is that all team members only need to maintain environment specific values in a single location, ie in the Platform Model.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply an OSB customization file with MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn each OSB project, export the OSB customization file as OSBCustomizationFile.xml (for both 11g and 12c OSB projects) and put it under the root directory of the OSB project. The below diagram shows a 12c example. \n\n\n\nModify the customization file to replace values with MyST property references. \n\n\n\nAdd any missing customization where required.\n\nCreate an OSB build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful OSB builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun OSB Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization is applied correctly.\n\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan \nIf the standard OSB customization file is not sufficient for your specific use case, then you can apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan. This solution can update any file in the OSB project. Fortunately, generic configuration plan only requires minimal configuration effort.\nIn some cases, an OSB customization file alone isn't enough to customize OSB projects to the target environment. For example, a proxy service may be configured with the File JCA transport, which contains environment specific JCA properties such as \"PhysicalArchiveDirectory\". These properties must also be replaced before OSB deployment.\nIn this case, MyST can use its own Generic Configuration Plan framework to capture environment properties and apply them to an artifact during deployment.\nDuring OSB deployment in MyST Studio, MyST reads the generic configuration plan and compiles it down to a list of actions to replace any environment specific values before importing the OSB jar file into the target environment via the OSB import function provided by MyST Studio.\nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply a MyST Generic Configuration Plan to an OSB deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nIn your file system, create a generic configuration plan file called myst-config-plan.xml. An example is given below. For detail see MyST Generic Configuration Plans\n\n\n\nPut this file under the META-INF folder in the OSB project's root directory.\n\nCreate an OSB build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: The plugin will automatically register Artifacts in Myst Studio for your successful OSB builds - you don't need to create them manually.\n\n\nCreate configurations for deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun OSB Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\nBAM Customization \nThis section provides details on customizing BAM projects with MyST Studio.\nThere is one customization that can be applied for customizing BAM projects against the target environment, this is:\n\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan\n\nOracle BAM allows users to create dashboards and monitor business services and processes. Typically, deploying BAM is a simple process of running the command line tool\nto export artifacts from a source environment into a zip file format, and then import that zip file into a target environment.\nThe command line tools are different for 11g and 12c as follow:\n\n11g: icommand (Location: /Oracle_SOA1/bam/bin)\n12c: bamcommand (Location: /soa/bam/bin)\n\nThere is no out-of-the-box customization solution for BAM provided by Oracle.\nIn 12c, typically developers manually modify the bam zip file, or use bespoke scripting, to amend any files with environment specific values before running the bamcommand utility. However, this approach presents a challenge to automated continuous integration.\nFortunately, MyST Studio's Generic Configuration Plans provide a simple yet powerful solution to overcome this issue. With generic configuration plans, only a single copy of the bam zip file needs to be maintained and no manual modification is required.\nApplying MyST Generic Configuration Plan \nMyST uses the generic configuration plan framework that can capture environment properties and apply them to an artifact during deployment.\nIn BAM deployment, a generic configuration plan replaces values in files within bam zip file with environment specific values before importing the bam zip file into the target environment via the bamcommand utility by MyST Studio.\n \nSteps \nThis section summarizes the steps to apply MyST Generic Configuration Plans on BAM deployment in MyST Studio.\n\nUpdate all Platform Models with the latest environment specific values in MyST Studio. \nPerform the below prerequisite steps, then export a bam zip file from the bam console. \n  Setting up 12c bamcommand\n  Update the /soa/bam/BAMCommandConfig.xml file to point to the correct BAM server host and port. Default is localhost.\n  An example for exporting an EMS Object\n  bamcommand -cmd export -type ems -name JMS -file /tmp/BAMObjects12c.zip\n\nNote: The above command will export an EMS object called \"JMS\" as well as any associated DO object.\n\n\nIn the file system, create a generic configuration plan file called myst-config-plan.xml. An example is given below. For detail see MyST Generic Configuration Plans\n\n\n\nThis generic configuration plan instructs MyST Studio to perform a search and replace on the ems/JMS/Ems.xml file inside the bam zip file, where the to-be-replaced element's location is expressed in the xpath, and the replace value containing the MyST property reference ${internal.soa.admin_url} will come from the MyST internal runtime engine.\n\nAdd this file to the bam zip file root directory. An example is given below.\n\n\n\nCreate a BAM build job in a CI server that integrates with MyST Studio via MyST Reverse Register Plugin.\n\nNote: At the time of writing, the reverse register plugin will not automatically register a CI managed Artifact for BAM builds.\n\n\nManually create a Third Party managed Artifact in MyST Studio with the correct group-artifact-classifier-version (GAVC) values for your BAM built artifact.\n\nCreate further configurations for BAM deployment in MyST Studio, such as creating a Release Pipeline or a Release Definition.\n\nRun BAM Deployment via MyST Studio and the customization will be applied correctly.\n\n\n"},"howtos/use-myst-generic-configuration-plans.html":{"url":"howtos/use-myst-generic-configuration-plans.html","title":"MyST Configuration Plans","keywords":"","body":"MyST Configuration Plans\nSome Oracle product artifacts cannot be customised at runtime using the out-of-the-box capabilities.

Over its lifecycle, an application will typically have multiple releases made into production, consisting of major and minor functional releases, as well as maintenance releases. \nDuring the lifetime of each release, code that makes up an Application Release will be built and promoted many times to various environments such as Development, System Integration Test (SIT), User Acceptance Test (UAT) and Pre-Prod as it makes its journey to Production.\nOver this journey, Application Blueprints are used to define the artifacts that constitute a version of an Application Release. The Application Blueprint is version controlled, allowing full control of the configuration of an Application release over time, and provides the flexibility to roll forward/backward to a different version of the release at any point in time.\nThis part contains the following chapters:\n\nConfiguring Application Blueprints   \n\n\n"},"deploy/application/blueprints/":{"url":"deploy/application/blueprints/","title":"Configuring Application Blueprints","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Application Blueprints\nList Application Blueprints\nFrom the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Application Blueprints, this will display a list of existing Application Blueprints, similar to the one below.\n\nBy default, MyST will display the list of Application Blueprints using the Card view.

See Application Blueprint versioning for further details.\n\n\nNext, we need to add the required artifacts to our application blueprint. Click on Add Artifact, this will open the Add Artifacts window, which by default will list all artifacts available.\n\nFor each artifact, MyST displays the following information:\n\nName - The artifact name\nGroup Id - The maven group id of the artifact.\nArtifact Id - The maven artifact id of the artifact.\nComponent Type - This is the type of artifact, for example, OSB, SCA, MDS, JAR and so on.\n\nWe can filter this list by one or more of these values by entering the filter criteria in the corresponding filter fields (outlined in red).\nTo add an artifact, simply select its checkbox; to remove an artifact from an Application Blueprint, deselect it.\nOnce happy with the selection click Add.

These stages will typically be aligned with each of the staging environments in our Software Delivery Lifecycle, for example, CI, SIT, UAT, and PROD.\nEach stage has a promotion scheme, which can be automatic or manual. Automatic is useful for Continuous Integration, whereas manual is useful when you want to control when the deployment is triggered. \nFor manual deployments, we also have the option of specifying whether it requires approval prior to deployment.\nRelease Streams\nA Release Pipeline can consist of one or more Release Streams. A Release Stream is targeted to an Oracle Middleware platform as defined by its Platform Blueprint and can contain zero or more Application Blueprints. \nA common use case for multiple Release Streams would be if you wanted to perform a release across multiple WebLogic domains, such as a release to an ADF and SOA WebLogic Domain.\nFor each stream, we would specify zero, one or more Application Blueprints that we want to deploy.\nDeployment Platforms\nFor each Stage / Release Stream combination, we need to specify the Platform Instances that we want to target the deployment of the corresponding Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprints to.\nFor example, if we have the stages CI, SIT, UAT and PROD in our Release Pipeline and a single stream SOA to manage the deployment of Oracle SOA artifacts, then we would need to specify the following four deployment targets:\n\nCI SOA Platform\nSIT SOA Platform\nUAT SOA Platform\nPROD SOA Platform \n\nAnd for every additional stream, we would need to specify an additional four Platform Instances.\nPipeline Groups and Stream Types\nPipeline Groups and Stream Types are user defined.

These may vary slightly based on the type of release. For example, we may follow one SDLC for \"project releases\", but have a shorter SDLC for \"patch\" releases.\nPipeline Templates allow us to pre-define a set of ordered stages with promotion schemes defined for each stage. The value of Pipeline Templates is that they allow us to define a standard approach for each type of release.\nFor example, in the above scenario, we could define two templates: one for project releases and a second for patch releases.\nThis part contains the following chapters:\n\nPipeline Organization   \nPipeline Groups   \nStream Types\n\n\nPipeline Templates\nConfiguring Release Pipelines\nRelease Pipeline Dashboards\n\n"},"release/pipeline/organization/":{"url":"release/pipeline/organization/","title":"Pipeline Organization","keywords":"","body":"Pipeline Organization\nPipeline Groups and Stream Types are user defined.

Templates","keywords":"","body":"Pipeline Templates\nIt is common practice for organizations to have a \"standard\" software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) that they follow for the implementation of Oracle Middleware projects. \nThese may vary slightly based on the type of release. For example, we may follow one SDLC for \"project releases\", but have a shorter SDLC for \"patch\" releases.\nPipeline Templates allow us to pre-define a set of ordered stages with promotion schemes defined for each stage. The value of Pipeline Templates is that they allow us to define a standard approach for each type of release.\nSo in the above example, we could define two templates: one for project releases and a second for patch releases.\nList Release Pipeline Templates\nFrom the side menu, navigate toRelease Management > Pipeline Template. This will display a list of existing Release Pipeline Templates, similar to the one below.\n\nCreating a New Release Pipeline Template\nClick + Create New. This will open the Release Pipeline Template dialogue. Specify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Pipeline Template.\nDescription - A longer description of the Pipeline Template.\n\n\nNext, we need to define the stages in our Release Pipeline Template.\nAdd Stage\nTo add a stage, click Add Stage. This will open the Stage dialogue. \n\nFor each stage, we need to specify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the stage.\nDescription - A longer description of the stage.\n\nEnvironment - The Environment Type to be used for this stage. Only Platform Models with the same environment type will be available for use in this stage.\n\nPromotion Rules - Defines how Application Blueprints and Platform Blueprints are promoted into this stage. This can be either:\n\nAutomatic - Instructs MyST to automatically promote changes to this stage. \nManual - Indicates that promotion has to be manually triggered.\n\n\n\nOnce we have defined our stage, click Save to add the stage to our Release Pipeline Template.\n\nNote: We will need to repeat these steps for each stage we wish to add to our Pipeline Template. For example, if our software delivery lifecycle consists of four stages, CI, SIT, PRE and PROD, then we would add a corresponding stage for each of these to our Release Pipeline template.\n\nSequence Stages\nBy default, the stages in our Release Pipeline will be sequenced in the order that we created them.\n\nIf we wish to change the stage sequence, simply click on the up or down arrow next to the stage (outlined in red in the above screenshot) to move it to an earlier or later stage in the pipeline template.\nOnce we are happy with our Release Pipeline Template, click Save to Save the new Release Pipeline Template.\nDelete Stage\nTo remove a stage from the Release Pipeline Template, click on the corresponding  trash can icon in the Actions column for the stage to be deleted.\nEdit Release Pipeline Template.\nTo edit the Pipeline Template, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipeline Template.

This will open the Release Pipeline dialogue. \n\nSpecify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Pipeline Template.\nDescription - A longer description of the Pipeline Template.\nPipeline Template - Select the Pipeline Template that we wish to base our Release Pipeline on. We can see that the list of Stages is automatically populated based on the selected template.\nPipeline Group - Select the Release Pipeline Group to which the pipeline belongs. \n\nBy default, the stages in our Release Pipeline, plus the sequence and configuration of each stage, is pre-configured as defined by the Release Pipeline Template. We can edit these if required.\n\nAdd Stage - To add a stage, click Add Stage. This will open the Stage dialogue. Here we need to specify the Stage Name, Description, Stage Environment Type and Promotion Rules.\n\nEdit Stage - To edit a stage, click on the pencil icon for the corresponding stage. This will open the  Stage dialogue. Here we can modify the Stage Name, Description, and Promotion Rules.\n\nDelete Stage - To delete a stage, click on the trash can icon for the corresponding stage.

If we want to change the stage sequence, simply click on the left or right arrow next to the stage (outlined in red in the above screenshot) to move it to an earlier or later stage in the pipeline.\n\n\nConfiguring Release Streams\nWithin a Release Pipeline, a Stream is used to define the Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprint(s) to be promoted through each stage.\nA Release Pipeline can consist of one or more Release Streams. A Release Stream is targeted to an Oracle Middleware platform as defined by its Platform Blueprint and can contain zero or more Application Blueprints. \nA common use case for multiple Release Streams would be if you wanted to perform a release across multiple WebLogic domains such as a release to an ADF and SOA WebLogic Domain.\nFor each stream, we would specify zero or more Application Blueprints that we want to deploy.\nAdd Streams\nTo add a stream to our Release Pipeline, click Add Stream. This will open the  Stream Editor. Here we need to specify the following values:\n\nName - Shorthand name for the Release Stream.\n\nDescription - A longer description of the Release Stream.\n\nStream Type - Select the Stream Type to which the stream belongs.\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Version - See Configuring a Streams Platform Blueprint Version.\n\nApplication Blueprint(s) - Select the Application Blueprints to be promoted through the stream\n\n\nConfiguring a Stream's Platform Blueprint Version\nFor each stream, we need to define its target Platform Blueprint and Version. Once defined MyST will only make available for deployment Platform Models / Instances that are based on the stream's Platform Blueprint and Version.\n\nThis is to ensure the Platform Instance deployed to at each stage of the Release Pipeline has the same configuration.\nAs it is possible to have multiple revisions of the same Platform Blueprint version, MyST also allows us to specify how we want MyST to handle a scenario where a Platform Instance is not on the latest committed revision of the Platform Blueprint version. \nThis is controlled with the Behavior option, which can be one of:\n\nUpdate - MyST will update the Platform Instance to the latest committed revision of the specified version of the Platform Blueprint and Model. The update action will be performed prior to deploying any Application Blueprints to the Platform Instance.\n\nNone - MyST will not perform any platform specific actions against the Platform Instance.\n\n\nConfiguring a Stream's Application Blueprints\nFor each stream, we need to define the set of Application Blueprints whose deployment and promotion we want to manage as part of the release pipeline.\nWithin the Application Blueprint(s) section of the Stream editor, select the required Application Blueprints from the list of Application Blueprints. \n\nFor each Application Blueprint we need to specify:\n\nVersion - Specifies the version of an Application Blueprint to be deployed.\n\nRevision - Each time there is a new revision of an artifact contained within an Application Blueprint, MyST will create a new revision of the Application Blueprint. Within a Release Stream, we can configure MyST to always use the latest revision of an Application Blueprint or pin a specific revision of an Application Blueprint to the stream.\n\nSequence - This defines the sequence in which Application Blueprints are deployed. To change the order, simply click on the up or down arrow next to the Application Blueprint (outlined in red above) to move it to an earlier or later stage in the deployment.\n\n\nConfiguring Platform Deployment Targets\nFor each stream, we need to specify the target platform for each stage in the Release Pipeline. The target platform is the Platform Instance to which MyST will apply the Platform Configuration changes as defined by the Platform Blueprint as well as deploy and configure the artifacts defined by the Application Blueprints.\nFor each Stream / Stage combination, we will see a drop down in the Release Pipeline (as outlined in red below). \n\nFrom this, we can select the Platform Model of the Platform Instance that we wish to target for deployment. The Platform Models available in the drop down will be automatically filtered:\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Version - The drop down list will be automatically filtered to only show Platform Models based on the Platform Blueprint and Version as specified in the stream configuration.\nEnvironment Type - The drop down list will be automatically filtered to only show Platform Models for the stage environment type as specified in the stage configuration.\n\nWhen we select the Platform Model, MyST will update the Release Pipeline to show the Platform Blueprint and Platform Model revision for the corresponding Platform Instance (as outlined in red above). If the Platform Instance has not yet been provisioned, then this will be indicated.\n\nActivate Release Pipeline\nOnce we have configured our Release Pipeline, we need to activate it before it can be used to promote a release into any environment.\nOnce activated, the pipeline will execute periodically to automatically promote changes through the pipeline (where configured to do so) as well as allow the manual promotion of releases.\nAs soon as we do this, MyST is going to start deploying our application into our CI environment because we set the CI stage to automatic.\nUpon activation, MyST will take us to the Release Pipeline Dashboard. Click on Refresh. We should now see that the deployment is pending.\n\nWhilst activated, the release pipeline configuration cannot be edited. The only change that can be made is to the Application Model Properties. If we need to edit the Release Pipeline, we first need to deactivate it. We can then make the required changes before re-activating the pipeline.\n\nTo activate a Release Pipeline Template, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines. This will display a list of existing Release Pipelines.\n\nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline you wish to activate and select Activate. MyST will prompt for confirmation of the activation, click Yes to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, from within the Release Pipeline editor, we choose the option of Save + Activate. MyST will save any changes made to the Release Pipeline and then activate the Pipeline. Once active, MyST will open the Release Pipeline Dashboard.\n\nDeactivate Release Pipeline\nThere are a number of occasions, where we may want to deactivate (or pause the execution of) a release pipeline, this includes when:\n\nWe want to make configuration changes to our Release Pipeline. For example, we may want to add additional Application Blueprints to an existing stream. \nWe have successfully delivered a release into Production, so may want to permanently deactivate the corresponding Release Pipeline.\nWe may want to delete a Release Pipeline, for example, we may be merging multiple releases into a single Pipeline.\n\nTo deactivate a Release Pipeline, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines. This will display a list of existing Release Pipelines. \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline you wish to deactivate and select Deactivate. MyST will prompt for confirmation of the Deactivate action, click Yes to proceed.\nOnce deactivated, MyST will stop the execution of the Release Pipeline until re-activated.\nDelete Release Pipeline\nMyST only allows the deletion of inactive pipelines. If we wish to delete a pipeline that is currently active, we first need to deactivate it.\nTo delete an inactive Release Pipeline, from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines. This will display a list of existing Release Pipelines. \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline you wish to remove and select Delete. MyST will prompt for confirmation of the Delete action, click Yes to proceed with the deletion of the Release Pipeline.\n"},"release/pipeline/dashboard/":{"url":"release/pipeline/dashboard/","title":"Release Pipeline Dashboards","keywords":"","body":"Release Pipeline Dashboards\nThe Release Pipeline Dashboard provides a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and manage the promotion of applications and platform configuration changes through each staging environment and into Production.\nTo view the dashboard of an active Release Pipeline; from the side menu navigate toRelease Management > Pipelines, this will display a list of existing Release Pipelines. \nClick on the Actions drop-down in the top right-hand corner of the pipeline whose dashboard we wish to view and select Dashboard.\n\nThe remainder of this section takes us on a tour of the Release Pipeline Dashboard, covering the following topics:\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Application Blueprint Revision Tracking\nPlatform Model and Application Model Revision Tracking\nBuild Stage\nDeployment to the First Staging Environment\nUnderstanding the Deployment Status\nPromoting a Release into a Staging Environment\nTroubleshooting a Failed Deployment\nUpdating the Application Model and Re-Deploying\nForcing a Redeploy\n\nPlatform Blueprint and Application Blueprint Revision Tracking\nEach stream in a Release Pipeline is used to manage the promotion and deployment of a set of related components, consisting of a Platform Blueprint and zero, one or more Application Blueprints. \nAny change to any of these components results in a new revision of that component. MyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted to each stage.\nWhen promoting a release from one stage to the next, the components are not promoted individually, but as the collection of components defined in the release stream. Each time a deployment is made into the first stage environment (for example CI), MyST creates a new Stream Revision which is a logical snapshot of the Platform Blueprint revision and Application Blueprint revision deployed into that staging environment.\nMyST keeps track of all revisions and which revision of each of these components has been promoted to each stage. The following notation is used to indicate the revision of each component:\n\nPlatform Blueprint Revisions - The revision of a platform Blueprint is indicated by the notation prn. Where pr is the standard prefix for a platform blueprint revision and n is the revision number. For example pr4 would indicate revision 4 for the specified Platform Blueprint Version.\nApplication Blueprint Revision - The revision of an Application Blueprint is indicated by the notation arn. Where ar is the standard prefix for an Application Blueprint revision and n is the revision number. For example ar3 would indicate revision 3 for the specified Application Blueprint Version.\nStream Revision - The revision of a Stream release is indicated by the notation srn. Where sr is the standard prefix for a Stream revision and n is the revision number. For example sr5 would indicate stream revision 5.\n\nIn addition to each stage, the dashboard also illustrates the Build stage, which shows the latest revision of each component available for promotion through the release pipeline. \nPlatform Model and Application Model Revision Tracking\nIn addition to tracking revisions to Platform Blueprints and Application Blueprints, MyST also tracks any revisions to either Platform Models or Application Models in each staging environment.\nFor example, a user may modify the set of properties defined in an Application Model, whilst this has no impact on the corresponding Application Blueprint. It does impact the configuration of the artifacts contained within the Application Blueprint for the stage that the Application Model applies. Thus it is important to track these changes, so MyST knows that the Application Blueprint needs to be redeployed, and allows us to cross-reference test results to particular configurations.\nIn addition, in a similar way that MyST creates a Stream Revision to track related components together, MyST creates a Stream Model Revision for each stage to track any model changes that impact that staging environment.\n\nNote: The Stream Model Revision is tracked separately for each stage.\n\nMyST keeps track of all model revisions and which revision has been applied to each component promoted into a stage. The following notation is used to indicate the model revision applied to each component:\n\nPlatform Model Revisions - The revision of a Platform Model is indicated by the notation pmn. Where pm is the standard prefix for a platform model revision and n is the revision number. For example pm2 would indicate revision 2 for the specified Platform Model.\nApplication Model Revision - The revision of an Application Model is indicated by the notation amn. Where am is the standard prefix for an Application Model revision and n is the revision number. For example am2 would indicate revision 2 for the specified Application Model.\nStream Model Revision - The revision of a Stream Model is indicated by the notation smn. Where sm is the standard prefix for a Stream Model revision and n is the revision number. For example sm5 would indicate stream model revision 5.\n\nBuild Stage\nIn addition to each stage, the dashboard also illustrates the Build stage, which shows the latest revision of each component available for promotion through the release pipeline. \n\nFor example, in the above screenshot, we can see that the following components (outlined in red) are available for deployment into the CI stage:\n\npr1 of SOA Platform Blueprint v1.0.0\nar2 of Utility Service v1.0\nar1 of OrderToCash\n\nThe stream revision in the build stage is used to indicate the next stream revision available for release into the first staging environment. The content of this release is not finalized until the deployment of this release is triggered. In other words, additional changes, prior to triggering of this release, which result in a new revision to either the Platform Blueprints or any of the Application Blueprints will be included in this stream revision.\nDeployment to the First Staging Environment\nWhen the promotion rule for the first staging environment is defined as automatic, MyST will periodically check to see if there are any new revisions in the build stage ready for deployment, and if so queue a deployment job against the platform instance, as indicated by the Pending status for Next Deployment in CI Stage in the screenshot below.\n\nNote: The Next execution at indicates when MyST will next check for new revisions to be promoted. This can be overridden by clicking Run Now.\n\nIf the promotion rule for the first staging environment is defined as Manual, MyST will indicate that a release is Ready for Release, which can then be triggered manually (see below for further details).\n\nThe deployment job will be placed in the job queue for the Platform Instance. This is to prevent multiple jobs for the same platform instance running in parallel. Once all preceding jobs (if any) in the queue have been completed then the deployment job will be initiated. The status of the deployment will change from Pending to In Progress as shown below.\n\nUnderstanding the Deployment Status\nOnce the deployment job has executed, the dashboard will be updated to show the status of the last deployment.\nThe Last Deployment section will highlight the Stream Revision and the Stream Model Revision of the last deployment, in the format srn - smn. This will be color coded:\n\nGreen - to indicate a successful deployment.\n\nRed - to indicate a failed deployment.\n\n\nIn addition, the dashboard will display the Status, Start Time and Duration of the deployment job.\n\nFor each Platform Blueprint and Application Blueprint, MyST will show the corresponding Blueprint Revision and Model Revision. These are color coded as follows:\n\nGreen - Indicates a successful deployment.\n\nLight Green - Indicates that no deployment was necessary, as there had been no change that impacted the deployed component since the last successful deployment.\n\nRed - to indicate a failed deployment.\n\n\nViewing the Deployment Log\nTo view the stage deployment log of a component, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding blueprint - model revision for the component, and select View Log as illustrated below.\n\nViewing the List of Deployed Artifacts\nTo view the list of artifacts deployed to a stage, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding platform instance and select Deployed Artifacts.\n\nMyST will display the list of artifacts currently deployed to that Platform Instance. For each artifact it displays:\n\nArtifact Group Id - The maven group id of the artifact.\n\nArtifact Id - The maven artifact id of the artifact.\n\nArtifact Version - This is the artifact binary version. \n\nBuild No - The build number of the artifact\n\nArtifact Name - The artifact name\n\n\nThis list can be sorted by clicking on the appropriate column heading.\n\nViewing Pending Action(s)\nTo view the Pending Action(s) for a Platform Instance in the Release Pipeline, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding platform instance and select Pending Action(s).\nThis will display a list of all scheduled actions against the Platform Instance, enabling us to determine if there are any actions queued ahead of our deployment actions.\nViewing the Action History\nTo view the Action History for a Platform Instance in the Release Pipeline, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding platform instance and select Action history.\nThis will open up the action history for the Platform Instance, which will show the history of all actions performed against the Platform Instance, not just those performed by the Release Pipeline.\nPromoting a Release into a Staging Environment\nOnce a release has been successfully deployed into a staging environment and has successfully executed any Post Deployment jobs, including the execution of automated tests, MyST will mark the corresponding Stream Revision as Ready for Release in the next staging environment.\nIf the promotion rule for the staging environment is defined as Manual, MyST will set the status of the Next Deployment as Ready for Release as well as indicate the stream revision plus corresponding stream model that is ready for revision.\nTo trigger the release, click on the Cog icon next to the corresponding Ready for Release status, and select Deploy Release as illustrated below.\n\nMyST will open the Revision Selection dialogue, where we can select which stream revision we wish to deploy and the corresponding stream model revision.\n\n\nIt is quite common, especially in the case of manual releases, for several stream revisions to be available for release at the same point in time. For example, we may make several releases a day into the CI environment, but choose to release daily into the test environment. In these scenarios MyST defaults to the latest successful stream revision, but allows us to select an earlier stream revision if required.\n\nFor the selected Stream Revision, MyST will show the corresponding platform blueprint and application blueprint revisions that make up this release. Once we are happy with the selected revision, click OK\nMyST will queue a deployment job against the corresponding platform instance. And set the status of the next deployment to Pending. As soon as the job starts executing, its status will be updated to In progress.\n\nTroubleshooting a Failed Deployment\nThere will, of course, be times when a deployment fails for a variety of reasons. In such cases, it is important to be able to quickly identify where the failure occurred, so we are able to identify the root cause.\nWhen a deployment fails, the status of the last deployment is set to Failed and the stream revision and stream model revision for that deployment is highlighted in red, as illustrated below.\n\nWhen MyST executes a stream deployment, it first deploys any updates to the Platform Blueprint and then sequentially deploys the Application Blueprint, skipping any components which have not changed since the last sequential deployment. If deployment of any component fails then deployment of the stream is aborted at that point.\nMyST will color code the status of each component to indicate whether it was deployed successfully or not:\n\nGreen - Indicates a successful deployment.\n\nLight Green - Indicates that no deployment was necessary, as there had been no change that impacted the component since the last successful deployment.\n\nRed - Indicate a failed deployment.\n\nGray - Indicates that MyST did not attempt to deploy that component due to an earlier failure.\n\n\nTo identify the root cause of the failed deployment, click on the Cog icon next to the failed component and select View Log. This will open the deployment Execution log file for that component.\n\nLooking at the log file we can see that we have not defined the following application (app.) properties:\n\nstock.host\nstock.port\n\nUpdating the Platform Model and Re-Deploying\nThe above issue can easily be resolved by setting these properties in the Platform Model for the SIT Platform Instances. See Platform Model Editor for details on how to do this.\nOnce the Platform Model has been updated, the next execution of the Release Pipeline will detect the updated Platform Model and set the status of the release to Ready for release.\nSelect the option to Deploy Release, ensuring the latest Stream Model is selected.\n\nFrom this we can see that the Stream Revision has been successfully deployed, and that the Application Model revision and the corresponding Stream Revision has been also been incremented to reflect the change at the model level.\nWe can also see that the Stream Revision is also available for deployment to the UAT Stage.\nForcing a Redeploy\nTo redeploy the last release to a stage, click on the Cog icon next to the last deployment status and select Redeploy. \n\nThis will open the redeploy dialogue.\n\nMyST's default behavior when deploying a release is to only deploy the artifacts that have been changed since the last deployment. In the event of an Application Model change it will redeploy all the artifacts contained within that Application Model.\nHere we have the option of selecting Force deploy all artifacts. If we select this option, we can force MyST to re-deploy all artifacts contained across Application Blueprints.\nClick OK to initiate the re-deployment.\n"},"administration/":{"url":"administration/","title":"Role-Based Access Control","keywords":"","body":"Role-Based Access Control\nWithin an enterprise, there will be multiple users of MyST, performing a variety of roles in a variety of environments from Development through to Production.For example:\n\nMiddleware Administrator: Provisioning, operation and administration of Production systems\nSOA Developer: Development and testing of code on SOA projects;  responsible for deploying code into DEV and TEST environments.\nQA Tech Lead: Provisioning and configuration of QA environments, plus the deployment of code into the QA environment.\nCI Tool: Tools such as Jenkins/Hudson, for orchestrating the automated deployment and testing of code in a Continuous Integration Environment.\n\nWithin MyST, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables us to control what resources a user has access to, and what actions they can perform across a number of dimensions, including:\n\nWhat actions a user can perform against each resource type, for example, Platform Blueprint, Platform Model, Application Blueprints, etc.\nEnvironments that a user is allowed to perform those actions in, for example, DEV, SIT, UAT, Pre-PROD, and PROD.\n\nUsers\nEach user has an individual account that at a minimum includes a unique login id, username, and password. \nWithin MyST, users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through the role(s) assigned to them within one or more workspaces. \nUsers can also be assigned System Roles, which will enable them to manage system specific configurations.\nRoles\nA role is a collection of application-related privileges that define what actions a user with that role may perform against each resource type, for example, Platform Blueprint, Platform Model, Pre-Existing Infrastructure and so on.\nA role can also be environment specific, in that it only grants application-related privileges in specific environments.

MyST will automatically build the data container on the first start.\n\nConfiguring Build Extensions\nIf you choose the Build Extensions for Oracle Middleware then you will need to download Oracle installers and place them in the MyST home at the following locations depending on the versions you chose\n\n\n\nVersion\nFile\n\n\n\n\nAll\nconf/fmw/context/jdk/jdk-8u121-linux-x64.tar.gz\n\n\n12.2.1.2.0\nconf/fmw/context/12.2.1.2.0/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_infrastructure.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.2.0\nconf/fmw/context/12.2.1.2.0/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_osb.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.2.0\nconf/fmw/context/12.2.1.2.0/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_soa.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.1.0\nconf/fmw/context/12.2.1.1.0/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_infrastructure.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.1.0\nconf/fmw/context/12.2.1.1.0/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_osb.jar\n\n\n12.2.1.1.0\nconf/fmw/context/12.2.1.1.0/installers/fmw_12.2.1.2.0_soa.jar\n\n\n\nOnce the Oracle installers are placed in the desired locations, you will need to build the FMW extensions by executing the following:\n./bin/build-fmw-extensions.sh\nStarting the MyST Studio Stack\nAfter the successful installation navigate to the MyST Studio home (in our example, /opt/myst-studio) and execute the following:\ncd /opt/myst-studio/bin\n./start.sh\nOnce the start.sh has completed you should be able to access the MyST Studio console at https:///console.\nYou can see the details of your running instances by executing docker ps from the command line.\nConfiguring Maven for Automated Build of Oracle Middleware\nIf you choose Build Extensions for Oracle Middleware when installing MyST, Maven must be configured on the build server, before you can build applications to run on products such as SOA, BPM, OSB and ADF. This can be done by simply executing the following from the MyST Studio home:\ncd bin\n./configure-maven.sh\nIf you skipped the post-installation steps documented in the section on Configuring the Build Extensions the above command will not succeed.\n\nOffline Installation\nIt is highly recommended that proxied internet access be available for the MyST server. This allows for easy upgrade of MyST by simplify specifying a version number to download (e.g. ./upgrade.sh 5.5.0.0). In an event that MyST Studio does not have internet access, you will need to download the required MyST Studio Docker Images from a host with internet access and then copy them to the MyST Server before executing the start.sh or upgrade.sh. Depending on whether you choose \"MyST Build Server\" and \"MyST Artifact Repository\", there may be multiple Docker images that need to be downloaded and copied to the server.\nMyST Studio (Offline)\nThe MyST Studio Docker Image can be downloaded from the MyST website.\n\nAfter downloading the MyST Studio installer from the website, copy it to the MyST host and execute the following\ngunzip myst-studio-docker-image-5.5.0.0.tar.gz\nsudo docker load -i myst-studio-docker-image-5.5.0.0.tar\ndocker tag  docker-registry.rubiconred.aws:5000/myst-studio:5.5.0.0 myst-studio\nMake sure that you replace the above version details to correspond to that version of MyST that was downloaded.\nMyST Build Server (Offline)\nIf you are planning to use MyST Build Server on a host without internet access, from a host with internet access and Docker installed run the following:\ndocker pull jenkins\ndocker save jenkins > myst-build-base.tar\nThen copy the myst-build-base.tar to the MyST host and execute the following:\ndocker load -i myst-build-base.tar\nMyST Artifact Repository (Offline)\nIf you are planning to use MyST Artifact Repository on a host without internet access, from a host with internet access and Docker + MyST installed run the following:\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh\ndocker save maven-repository > maven-repository.tar\nThen copy the maven-repository.tar to the MyST host and execute the following:\ndocker load -i maven-repository.tar\nBuild Extensions for Oracle Middleware (Offline)\nIf you are planning to use MyST Artifact Repository on a host without internet access, from a host with internet access and Docker + MyST installed run the following:\ndocker pull oraclelinux:7\ndocker save oraclelinux:7 > oracle-linux.tar\nThen copy the oracle-linux.tar to the MyST host and execute the following:\ndocker load -i oracle-linux.tar\n"},"installation/myst-studio/alternatives/":{"url":"installation/myst-studio/alternatives/","title":"Alternative Installation Approaches","keywords":"","body":"Alternative Installation Approaches\nGenerally, it is recommended that MyST be installed on Docker. This will enable the easiest rollout process of MyST and it's associated components as well as allowing for effortless upgrades. As new releases of MyST are shipped regularly, being able to upgrade in seconds is a desirable trait of the system. For details on installing MyST with Docker please visit this link.\n \nRecommendations aside, it is important to recognise there can be some internal constraints within an organization which prevents the use of Docker, at least in the short-term. This guide is designed for such scenarios.\nEnterprise constraints preventing use of Docker\nAn enterprise may lag behind high-performing companies for various reasons. Below are a list of common constraints in an enterprise that may prevent the use of Docker.\n\nUnable to use up-to-date kernel\nDocker requires a new-ish kernel version. Enterprises may have a Standard Operating Environment (SOE) and may not be ready to upgrade their Linux kernel to support Docker. Please refer to the Docker documentation for your specific Operating System to determine the kernel version required.\n\nRequire out-of-date Docker version\nThis is related to the previous point. If an organisation's SOE prevents the use of an up-to-date kernel then there may be a need to install an older version of Docker. Alternatively, an organisation may have an out-of-date Operating System package manager responsible for delivering out-of-date Docker versions to an operation system.\nMyST relies on the v2 compose file format meaning that it will not work with earlier versions of Docker. If you wish to use an earlier version of Docker, please raise a support ticket for assistance in configuring MyST to work with earlier versions of Docker.\n\nWaiting on a purchasing decision\nOrganisation's may choose to use RedHat or Oracle Linux. Since version 17.3+,  Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) must be licensed for  Red Hat / Oracle Linux. \nIn this case, an organisation can choose to use Docker Community Edition (CE) with non-RedHat / Oracle Linux operating systems such as the RedHat-based CentOS or other Linux derivatives such as Ubuntu. If an organisation is not willing to license EE, downgrade Docker or use a CE supporting operating system, Docker may no longer be a viable option.\n\n\nThis document exists for edge cases where an alternative means for installing MyST Studio is required. While the Docker-based installation can take minutes, the manual installation could take several hours and should be followed as a late resort only.\nInstall MyST Studio Manually (without Docker)\nMyST can be installed to run without Docker through a three step process.\n\nInstall MySQL\nInstall MyST on a Docker supporting system to extract the MyST application and configuration.\nCopy the extracted MyST application and configuration to the non-Docker host and wire it to the MySQL database.\n\nInstall MySQL Community Edition\nMyST Studio uses MySQL Community Edition 5.7.15 to store its data. Before we install MyST Studio we must ensure that a running instance of MySQL is available and configured. General MySQL installation details can be found here\n\nDownload the yum repo file that is needed for the specific target operating system.\nThe available repo file for RedHat/Oracle Linux based systems are listed here so you download to the box with a command line this: \nwget http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el6-9.noarch.rpm\n\nInstall the repo\nsudo yum localinstall mysql57-community-release-el6-9.noarch.rpm\n\nInstall MySQL Community Edition 5.7.15\nsudo yum install mysql-community-server\n\nStart MySQL\nsudo service mysqld start\n\nVerify that it is running\nsudo service mysqld status\nmysqld (pid  1340) is running...\n\nAt the initial start-up of the server, the following happens, given that the data directory of the server is empty:\n\nThe server is initialized.\nAn SSL certificate and key files are generated in the data directory.\nThe validate_password plugin is installed and enabled.\nA superuser account 'root'@'localhost is created. A password for the superuser is set and stored in the error log file. To reveal it, use the command described in the next step.\n\n\nGet the super user password\nsudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log\n\nChange the root password as soon as possible by logging in with the generated, temporary password and set a custom password for the superuser account. \n\n\nMySQL's validate_password plugin is installed by default. This will require that passwords contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, and one special character, and that the total password length is at least 8 characters.\n   The default MyST password is not allowed by the password validation. You may choose to remove that module and set it to the default MyST password\n (welcome1).\n   mysql -uroot -p \n   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass4!';\n   uninstall plugin validate_password;\n   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome1';\n\nCreate the fusioncloud schema and userCREATE USER 'fusioncloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome1';\nCREATE DATABASE fusioncloud;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fusioncloud.* to 'fusioncloud'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n\nIncrease MySQL max allowed packet by editing /etc/my.cnf with the following under [mysqld] section[mysqld]\nmax_allowed_packet = 256M\n\n\nObtain the MyST product from a Docker installation.\nTo keep the MyST installation in line with what is built and delivered as part of the Docker image for MyST, we obtain a non-Docker copy of MyST product by first installing MyST on a machine which supports Docker, followed by retrieving the MyST file system and copying it to a non-Docker host. This will involve installing Docker on a supporting operating system and pulling down a specific version of a docker image for MyST, followed by creating a tar achive of the tomcat directory with the related MyST application and configuration. For information on Docker and MyST Studio installation refer to \n Docker install for your operating system version\n MyST Studio installation.\n\nOnce MyST and Docker are installed, retrieve the desired imagecd /opt/myst-studio/bin\n./pull\n\nObtain the image name for MyST. You can see a list of Docker images on the host by running docker images that will yiel an output similar to:REPOSITORY                                               TAG    IMAGE ID     CREATED     SIZE\n067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio latest 91c4a4f58d2c 4 weeks ago 484.3 MB\n\nStart a container from the MyST Studio docker image using:\ndocker run -ti --name myststudio-tomcat : /bin/bash\nwhere : is obtained from previously running the docker images command\n\nTar the contents of the tomcat directory by first entering the container.

Modify the following tag in /opt/myst-studio/tomcat/conf/server.xml.\n\nTo reflect the port change and allow authentication to work properly, update the following value in /opt/app/myst-studio/tomcat/conf/fusioncloud/fc-configuration.properties\nfc.oauth.endpoint=http://localhost:8085/fc\nUpdate /opt/myst-studio/tomcat/conf/context.xml with the password you used the fusioncloud MySQL user.\nSet the java memory parameters by adding the following line to /opt/app/myst-studio/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh\nexport JAVA_OPTS=\"-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xms128m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=64m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\"\nStart Tomcat as follows:\n/opt/app/myst-studio/tomcat/bin/startup.sh\nAccess MyST Studio by going to http://:8085/console\n\n"},"administration/upgrade/":{"url":"administration/upgrade/","title":"MyST Upgrade Guide","keywords":"","body":"MyST Upgrade Guide\nNew MyST features and bug fixes are frequently made available. Enterprises can easily upgrade their on-premise instance of MyST Studio by pulling down the latest version directly from the web or in-directly by downloading the associated Docker images and copying them up to the MyST host.\nIf you are a MyST customer, who started using MyST prior to 2016, you may still be using the MyST Command-Line Interface. For details on upgrading from MyST CLI to MyST Studio see the associated section within this guide.\nUpgrade Approaches\nThere are a number of different approaches that can be taken for upgrading MyST Studio. It is advisable to choose an approach that is appropriate for your organisations availability requirements. As the downtime during an upgrade is reduced the complexity of the upgrade generally increases. For that reason, the choice of upgrade approach is generally a trade off between reducing downtime and reducing complexity. The most common upgrade approaches are:\n\nIn-Place Upgrade: This involves upgrading a single instance of MyST Studio in-place. This will require a small downtime.\nPhased Upgrade: This involves testing an upgrade on a non-production instance, before performing the upgrade on the production instance. This will still require a small downtime.\nZero Downtime Upgrade: This involves side-by-side upgrade of MyST Studio in order to reduce downtime or avoid it altogether.\n\nIn-Place Upgrade\nThe simplest upgrade approach is to have a single instance which is upgraded in-place. This upgrade approach will require an outage.\nUpgrade Steps\nStep 1: Perform the upgrade\nThis can be executed by running the following on the MyST Studio host.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/upgrade.sh \n\nThis will require an outage of the MyST Studio instance. For a typical upgrade the outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\n\n\n\nMyST Studio Script\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh\nPulls the MyST Studio container from the Public MyST Docker Registry using the customer key and tags it as myst-studio. If internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps. docker load -i  docker tag  myst-studio\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/backup-database.sh\nPerforms a backup of the database to MyST Studio home under the backup directory with a datetime suffix. The location is printed to the output. For example: Backed up to /opt/myst-studio/backup/myst-studio-1468979016.sql Take note of the location as you will require this later if you intend to perform a rollback.\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/stop.sh\nStops the MyST Studio instances\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/start.sh\nStarts the MyST Studio instances. On boot, the MyST Studio web instance will upgrade the database.\n\n\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/output-logs.sh\nThis displays the MyST Studio start up logs during startup.  This can be closed by typing Ctrl+C.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Verify the upgrade\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\n\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct. \n\nRollback Steps\nIn the event of a failure during the upgrade the following steps can be performed to rollback the instance.\nStep 1: Re-tag the old image\nFind the previous version of the MyST Studio Docker Image. To see all version, you can execute the following:\ndocker images | grep myst-studio\nRe-tag the image to be called \"myst-studio\". This will ensure on the next startup that the earlier version of MyST Studio is used. Below is an example for downgrade to MyST 3.9.0.3\ndocker tag 067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio:3.9.0.3 myst-studio\nStep 2: Restore the database\nThis can be executed by running the following on the MyST Studio host.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will perform an outage of the MyST Studio instance. This outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\nThe following steps are performed as part of the database update.\n\nThe MyST Studio web instance is stopped.\nThe backup SQL is executed on the database\nThe MyST Studio web instance is started.Step 3: Verify the downgrade\nAt a minimum, the following downgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct. \n\n\n\nPros / Cons\nPros:\n\nSimple to setup\nNo need to manage the migration of data between instances\n\nCons:\n\nRequires an outage to perform an upgrade\nNo way to test an upgrade prior to applying it\n\nPhased Upgrade\nThis approach involves the use of separate production and non-production instances. An upgrade is first tested on non-production before applying to production.\nUpgrade Steps\nStep 1: Download the latest version of MyST Studio\nThis can be executed by running the following command.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh \nIf internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps.\ndocker load -i \ndocker tag  myst-studio\nStep 2: Take a copy of the latest production state and import to non-production (optional)\nThis step is optional if you wish to verify with the same instance data as production.\nThe involves first taking a copy of production database of MyST Studio by executing the following\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/backup-database.sh\nThe location of the backup will be output to the terminal.\nNext, the backup will need to be copied to the non-production host and the following will need to be executed.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will shutdown and restart the MyST Studio web instance. Because we previously downloaded the latest MyST Studio, it will be upgraded to the latest MyST Studio version on startup.\nStep 3: Upgrade MyST Studio\nIf you performed the previous step, then your instance should already be upgraded. If not you can upgrade the instance by doing a restart as follows:\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/restart.sh\nStep 4: Verify the upgrade on non-production\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct. \nStep 5: If upgrade is successful, perform upgrade on production\nThis can be done from the production machine by executing the following:\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/upgrade.sh \nThis will require an outage of the MyST Studio instance. For a typical upgrade the outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\nStep 6: Verify the upgrade on production\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct. \nRollback Steps\nIn the event of a failure during the upgrade the following steps can be performed to rollback the instance.\nStep 1: Re-tag the old image\nFind the previous version of the MyST Studio Docker Image. To see all version, you can execute the following:\ndocker images | grep myst-studio\nRe-tag the image to be called \"myst-studio\". This will ensure on the next startup that the earlier version of MyST Studio is used. Below is an example for downgrade to MyST 3.9.0.3\ndocker tag 067343992071.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myst-studio:3.9.0.3 myst-studio\nStep 2: Restore the database\nThis can be executed by running the following on the MyST Studio host.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will perform an outage of the MyST Studio instance. This outage should be no longer than 5 minutes.\nThe following steps are performed as part of the database update.\nThe MyST Studio web instance is stopped.\nThe backup SQL is executed on the database\nThe MyST Studio web instance is started.\nStep 3: Verify the downgrade\nAt a minimum, the following downgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct. \nPros / Cons\nPros:\n\nAllows for an upgrade to be tested before introducing it to production\nProvides a sandbox for testing configuration prior to moving to productionCons:\n\nRequires an outage to perform an upgrade\nIf not using the same data as production (i.e. skipping step 2), it may not be an accurate upgrade verification for production.\nMore complex to setup than single instance\n\nZero Downtime Upgrade\nWith this upgrade strategy, there is two instances (blue and green). At any given time, the DNS record will point to one of the two instances. This allows for an upgrade to be performed on the non-active instance in isolation and once ready, the DNS record can be updated to point traffic to this instance. This approach has the benefit of there not being any outage required when performing the upgrade.\nUpgrade Steps\nBelow are the steps for upgrading our green instance and switching over from our blue instance. If our green instance were the active instance we would reverse blue and green in the below steps.\nStep 1: Download the latest version of MyST Studio on the green instance\nThis can be executed by running the following command.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/pull.sh \nIf internet access is not available from the MyST Studio host this will need to be performed manually by downloading the Docker image from the MyST website and performing the following steps.\ndocker load -i \ndocker tag  myst-studio\nStep 2: Set blue repository to read-only (optional)\nPrior to upgrading the instance, we will take an export of our blue instance database. During this period, if a user were to make a change on the blue instance it would be lost when we switch over to the green instance. In order to prevent changes, you may wish to make the blue repository read-only as follows:\ndocker exec -ti myststudio_db mysql -u root -pwelcome1\nmysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;\nmysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;\nmysql> exit\nStep 3: Take a copy of the latest blue instance state and import to the green instance\nThe involves first taking a copy of blue database of MyST Studio by executing the following\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/backup-database.sh\nThe location of the backup will be output to the terminal.\nNext, the backup will need to be copied to the green host and the following will need to be executed.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/update-database.sh \nThis step will shutdown and restart the MyST Studio web instance. Because we previously downloaded the latest MyST Studio, it will be upgraded to the latest MyST Studio version on startup.\nBe sure to disable the read only mode on the database by executing the following:\ndocker exec -ti myststudio_db mysql -u root -pwelcome1\nmysql> SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;\nmysql> UNLOCK TABLES;\nmysql> exit\nStep 4: Verify the upgrade on the green instance\nAt a minimum, the following upgrade verification steps should be performed.\nCheck there are no errors shown in the MyST Studio start up log\nLogin to the MyST Studio console and check that the version shown in the bottom right-hand corner is correct. \nStep 5: If upgrade is successful, switch the DNS record to point to the green instance\nThis would simply involve updating the DNS record which is currently pointing to the blue instance so that it points to the green instance.\nFor the next upgrade, the DNS record will be pointed back to the blue instance.\nRollback Steps\nThe rollback process is straight forward for Blue / Green. If an issue is encountered during the upgrade process then it won't impact the active instance so there is no rollback required other than setting the instance back from read-only if this was set.\nPros / Cons\nPros\n\nAllows for an upgrade to be tested without any production outage\nTakes the pressure off an upgrade by allowing it to be done independently of an outage\nBuild-in DR strategyCons\n\nMore complex to setup than single instance \nWhile the database is in read-only, any builds from the CI server (e.g. Jenkins) will not be propagated to MyST Studio. The would need to be re-run afterwards for all the failed build jobs.\n\nUpgrading from CLI to Studio\nMyST CLI users will have a MyST Workspace which is a folder for storing Platform Blueprints and Models in XML or Properties notation. The easiest way to start managing these Platform Instances outside the MyST CLI is to first push them to up to MyST Studio. This can be done by executing the following from the MyST Workspace.\n/opt/myst-studio/bin/cli2studio -h localhost -p 443\n...where in the example above MyST Studio is running on localhost:443\n"},"appendix/artifact/":{"url":"appendix/artifact/","title":"Supported Artifacts","keywords":"","body":"Supported Artifacts\n\n\nSCA\nOSB\nMDS\nADF\nJava EAR\nJava WAR\nSQL\nB2B\nBAM\nMFT\nApplication Configuration (Properties/XML)\nOSB Custom XPath\nOWSM Policy\nJAR Library\nJava Shared Library\n\n\nSCA\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncomposite.configuration-plan\nOptional: SOA configuration plan to override endpoint, fault policy location etc. Can be a path on the target host ( [DOMAIN_HOME]/plans/cap.sca.configplan.xml) or a path in the packaged artifact ((EMBEDDED)/cap.sca.configplan.xml)\n\n\ncomposite.name\nSOA composite name for deployment or undeployment\n\n\ncomposite.partition\nSOA partition name to deploy composite into.
